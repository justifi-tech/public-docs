## Prerequisites

Before you begin integration, ensure you have:

### 1. JustiFi Dashboard Access
- Login credentials provided by your Customer Success representative
- Access the dashboard at [https://app.justifi.ai](https://app.justifi.ai/)

### 2. API Credentials
To generate your API credentials:
1. Log into the JustiFi dashboard
2. Navigate to **Developers**
3. Toggle **Test Mode** ON for sandbox environment testing
4. Go to **API Keys** and create a test API key
5. Store your API key securely - it determines your environment (test/production)

### 3. Environment Setup
- **Test Environment**: Use test API keys for development and testing
- **Production Environment**: Use production API keys for live transactions
- The API key environment automatically routes your requests to the correct environment

### Step 4: Process Your First Payment

Once your merchant is approved (typically 1-2 business days), you can start processing payments:

#### Using Hosted Checkout:
```bash
curl -X POST https://api.justifi.ai/v1/checkouts \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "sub_account_id": "sa_123",
    "amount": 1000,
    "currency": "usd",
    "description": "Test payment"
  }'
```

Redirect customers to the returned `checkout_url`.
