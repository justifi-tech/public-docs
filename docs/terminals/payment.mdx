# Process a Card Present Payment
Once you have [configured a terminal device](https://docs.justifi.tech/terminals/configuration) 
and [confirmed its `CONNECTED` status](https://docs.justifi.tech/terminals/configuration#check-the-terminal-status) 
you can verify the terminal via test payment or attempt a payment via API.

## Verify the Terminal
To test the device is configured correctly you can process a test payment of $1 via **"Verify Terminal"** 
on the JustiFi dashboard:\
Go to https://app.justifi.ai/ and choose **"Terminals"** from the **"Payments"** dropdown. 
Click into the specific terminal you want to test and click **"Verify Terminal"** on the detail view.\
Once you confirm the dialog the terminal device will receive the $1 payment 
which you can complete with a valid credit card.

After the terminal payment has been completed you can view the payment on the JustiFi dashboard:\
Go to https://app.justifi.ai/ and choose **"Payments"** from the **"Payments"** dropdown 
or retrieve it via the [List Payments API](https://docs.justifi.tech/api-spec#tag/Payments/operation/ListPayments).

## Technical Payment Integration
We have outlined how to integrate payment processing via terminals in our [Card Present documentation](https://developer.justifi.ai/tag/Terminals).

The short version is: [Create a checkout](https://docs.justifi.tech/api-spec#tag/Checkouts/operation/CreateCheckout). 
Pick a terminal and use the [Pay Terminal API](https://docs.justifi.tech/api-spec#tag/Terminals/operation/payTerminal) 
to process the checkout. If there are errors, the checkout completion record will be updated with information 
on what error occurred. 

We recommend listening to the `checkout.completion.succeeded` event to handle successful payments and the `checkout.completion.failed` event to handle a failed 
or canceled terminal payment.\
See the [Checkout Completion Event documentation](https://docs.justifi.tech/api-spec#tag/Events/operation/checkoutCompletionEvent) for more information.

A few other notes:
- Terminal payments will time out after 90 seconds
- You can click the **"X"** on the device to cancel a terminal payment
- The credit card information collected for a terminal payment is stored in a payment method record with the `payment_method_type` `card_present`.
This type of payment method is considered "single use" and can currently not be used for other payments. 
- Once a payment is successfully collected for a checkout, the payment ID will be added to the checkout record as `successful_payment_id`. 

To retrieve the checkout or payment use the [Get Checkout API](https://docs.justifi.tech/api-spec#tag/Checkouts/operation/GetCheckout) 
or the [Get Payment API](https://docs.justifi.tech/api-spec#tag/Payments/operation/GetPayment).\
The checkout as well as the payment also appear in your JustiFi dashboard:\
Go to https://app.justifi.ai/ and choose **"Checkouts"** or **"Payments"** from the **"Payments"** dropdown.
