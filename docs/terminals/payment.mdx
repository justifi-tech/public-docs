# Process a Card Present Payment

## Verify Terminal
To test the device is configured correctly you can process a test payment of $1 on the device via “Verify Terminal” button 
on the JustiFi dashboard (Go to https://app.justifi.ai/ and choose “Terminals” from the “Payments” dropdown. 
Click into the specific device you want to test). 
Once you confirm the “Verify Terminal” dialog the terminal will receive the $1 payment 
which you can complete with a valid credit card.

After the terminal payment has been completed you can view the payment in your JustiFi dashboard 
(Go to https://app.justifi.ai/ and choose “Payments” from the “Payments” dropdown) 
or retrieve it via the [List Payments API](https://docs.justifi.tech/api-spec#tag/Payments/operation/ListPayments).

## Technical Payment Integration
We have outlined how to integrate payment processing via terminals in our [Card Present documentation](https://developer.justifi.ai/tag/Terminals).

The short version is: Create a Checkout. Pick a terminal and use the [Pay Terminal API](https://docs.justifi.tech/api-spec#tag/Terminals/operation/payTerminal) 
to process the checkout. If there are errors, the checkout completion record will be updated with information 
on what error occurred. 

We recommend listening to the `checkout.completion.succeeded` event to handle successful payments and the `checkout.completion.failed` event to handle a failed or canceled terminal payment. 
See the [Checkout Completion Event documentation](https://docs.justifi.tech/api-spec#tag/Events/operation/checkoutCompletionEvent) for more information.

A few other notes:
Terminal payments will eventually time out, they are set at 90 seconds at the moment
You can click the “X” on the device to cancel a terminal payment
The credit card information collected for a terminal payment is stored in a payment method record that can currently not be used for other payments. The payment method is considered “single use” and has the payment method type “card_present”.

Once a payment is successfully collected for a checkout, the payment ID will be added to the checkout record as `successful_payment_id`. 

To retrieve the checkout or payment use the [Get Checkout API](https://docs.justifi.tech/api-spec#tag/Checkouts/operation/GetCheckout) or the [Get Payment API](https://docs.justifi.tech/api-spec#tag/Payments/operation/GetPayment).

The checkout as well as the payment also appear in your JustiFi dashboard: Go to https://app.justifi.ai/ and choose “Checkouts” or “Payments” from the “Payments” dropdown.
