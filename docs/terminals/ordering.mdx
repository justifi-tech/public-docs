# Order Terminal Devices

## Overview
To order terminal devices for your merchants (sub accounts) you can either use the Terminal Orders API, 
set up the Order Terminals web component on your platform or place the order on the JustiFi dashboard.

## Via Terminal Orders API
Use the [Order Terminals API](https://docs.justifi.tech/api-spec#tag/Terminals-Orders/operation/terminalsOrder) to order one or multiple terminal devices for an enabled sub account. 
Once the order is placed you can retrieve it via [Get Terminals Order API](https://docs.justifi.tech/api-spec#tag/Terminals-Orders/operation/GetTerminalsOrder). 
To get the sub account ID and business ID of the sub account required for ordering terminals use the [List Sub Accounts API](https://docs.justifi.tech/api-spec#tag/Sub-Accounts/operation/ListSubAccounts) and filter by “enabled” status.

## Via Order Terminals Web Component
If you prefer for your sub accounts to directly order terminal devices on your platform you can use the Terminal Orders web component. More information to come.

## Via JustiFi Dashboard
Go to https://app.justifi.ai/ - Choose “Terminals” from the “Payments” dropdown and select the “Terminal Orders” tab. 
Click the “Order Terminals” button and select the business you are ordering devices for. 
Confirm the “Shipping Address” displayed in the dialog is correct. 
Select the model(s) and the number of devices (up to 20) and submit the order. 
It will appear in the list of “Terminal Orders”. To view the order details click into the order on the list.
