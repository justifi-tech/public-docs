# Order or Provision Terminal Devices

## Order Terminals

To order terminal devices for your merchants (sub accounts) you can either use the Terminal Orders API,
set up the Order Terminals web component on your platform or place the order on the JustiFi dashboard.\
The sub account you intend to order terminals for must be onboarded with JustiFi and enabled for payment processing.
The terminals will be automatically shipped to your sub account.

### Via Terminal Orders API

Use the [Order Terminals API](https://docs.justifi.tech/api-spec#tag/Terminals-Orders/operation/terminalsOrder) and pass `"boarding_shipping"` as `order_type`
to order one or multiple terminal devices for an enabled sub account.\
Once the order is placed you can retrieve it via [Get Terminals Order API](https://docs.justifi.tech/api-spec#tag/Terminals-Orders/operation/GetTerminalsOrder).\
To get the necessary `sub_account_id` and `business_id` of the sub account use the [List Sub Accounts API](https://docs.justifi.tech/api-spec#tag/Sub-Accounts/operation/ListSubAccounts) and filter by `enabled` status.

### Via Order Terminals Web Component

If you prefer for your sub accounts to directly order terminal devices on your platform
you can utilize the [Order Terminals web component](/web-components/merchant-tools/order-terminals).
The `shipping` prop value you pass to the web component must be `boarding_shipping`.

### Via JustiFi Dashboard

Go to https://app.justifi.ai/ and choose **"Terminals"** from the **"Payments"** dropdown. On the **"Terminals"** list select the **"Terminal Orders"** tab.
Click the **"Order Terminals"** button and select the business you order devices for.
Confirm the **"Shipping Address"** displayed in the dialog is correct.
Select the model(s) and the number of devices (up to 20) and submit the order.\
The `created` order will appear in the list of **"Terminal Orders"**. To view the order details click into the order on the list.

## Track Terminal Order

After the order was `created` you can track the order progress via the terminal's **"Order Status"** on the JustiFi dashboard or via API.\
The order status will change from `created` to `submitted` as soon as the order was submitted to Verifone.
When the order ships the order status will change to `completed`.
At that point the Fedex `Tracking Number` will appear on the **"Order Details"** page.
In the response of the get terminal order API the tracking number property is called `shipping_tracking_reference`.

To get real time updates on status changes of the order you can subsribe to the
[terminal order events](https://docs.justifi.tech/api-spec#tag/Events/operation/terminalOrderEvent)
`terminal_order.created` and `terminal_order.updated`.
Create an event publisher on the JustiFi dashboard to receive these updates:
Go to https://app.justifi.ai/ and choose **"Event Publishers"** from the **"Developer"** dropdown.
Click `Add Publisher` and select the terminal order events.

## Assign Nickname

To simplify identifying and handling a specific terminal device you can assign a nickname to it
as soon as the terminal order was created and the ordered terminals appear in the **"Associated Terminals"** list
on the bottom of the **"Order Details"** page.
To do that use the [Update Terminal API](https://docs.justifi.tech/api-spec#tag/Terminals/operation/updateTerminal).

<!--
or edit the **"Nickname"** field on the **"Terminal Details"** page on the JustiFi dashboard.
-->

The nickname can be changed at any time via the same methods.

## Provision Terminal Devices

If you bulk ordered terminal devices from JustiFi and want to ship them to your merchants (sub accounts)
you need to assign them to the specific sub accounts before sending them out.
This process is called **"Provisioning"**.
You can provision terminals for your sub accounts via the Terminal Orders API, on the JustiFi dashboard or by integrating the Order Terminals web component in your platform.\
The sub account you provision terminals for must be onboarded with JustiFi and enabled for payment processing.
Once you have provisioned the devices you can send them to your sub account(s).

### Via Terminal Orders API

Use the [Order Terminals API](https://docs.justifi.tech/api-spec#tag/Terminals-Orders/operation/terminalsOrder) and pass `"boarding_only"` as `order_type`.\
Once the provisioning order is placed you can retrieve it via [Get Terminals Order API](https://docs.justifi.tech/api-spec#tag/Terminals-Orders/operation/GetTerminalsOrder).\
To get the necessary `sub_account_id` and `business_id` of the sub account use the [List Sub Accounts API](https://docs.justifi.tech/api-spec#tag/Sub-Accounts/operation/ListSubAccounts) and filter by `enabled` status.

### Via JustiFi Dashboard

Go to https://app.justifi.ai/ and choose **"Terminals"** from the **"Payments"** dropdown.
On the **"Terminals"** list select the **"Terminal Orders"** tab.
Click the **"Provision Terminals"** button and select the business you provision devices for.
Confirm the business information displayed in the dialog is correct.
Select the model(s) and the number of devices and submit.\
The `created` order will appear in the list of **"Terminal Orders"**.
To view the order details click into the order on the list.
The **"Order Detail"** view shows the assigned terminals on the bottom of the page.
Note the **"Device ID"** (or "DID") assigned to each provisioned terminal.
Make sure to provide this DID to your sub account when you ship the terminal device to them.
They will need to enter that DID into the device after they set up WIFI on the device.
See the [Configuration section](https://docs.justifi.tech/terminals/configuration) for details.

### Via Order Terminals Web Component

If you prefer for your sub accounts to directly provision terminal devices on your platform
you can utilize the [Order Terminals web component](/web-components/merchant-tools/order-terminals).
The `shipping` prop value you pass to the web component must be `boarding_only` for provisioning.
