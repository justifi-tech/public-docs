# Order Terminal Devices

## Overview
To order terminal devices for your merchants (sub accounts) you can either use the Terminal Orders API, 
set up the Order Terminals web component on your platform or place the order on the JustiFi dashboard.\
The sub account you intend to order terminals for must be onboarded with JustiFi and enabled for payment processing. 

## Via Terminal Orders API
Use the [Order Terminals API](https://docs.justifi.tech/api-spec#tag/Terminals-Orders/operation/terminalsOrder) 
to order one or multiple terminal devices for an enabled sub account.\
Once the order is placed you can retrieve it via [Get Terminals Order API](https://docs.justifi.tech/api-spec#tag/Terminals-Orders/operation/GetTerminalsOrder).\
To get the necessary `sub_account_id` and `business_id` of the sub account use the [List Sub Accounts API](https://docs.justifi.tech/api-spec#tag/Sub-Accounts/operation/ListSubAccounts) and filter by `enabled` status.

## Via Order Terminals Web Component
If you prefer for your sub accounts to directly order terminal devices on your platform you can set up the Terminal Orders web component.
Details coming soon. 

## Via JustiFi Dashboard
Go to https://app.justifi.ai/ and choose **"Terminals"** from the **"Payments"** dropdown. On the **"Terminals"** list select the **"Terminal Orders"** tab. 
Click the **"Order Terminals"** button and select the business you are ordering devices for. 
Confirm the **"Shipping Address"** displayed in the dialog is correct. 
Select the model(s) and the number of devices (up to 20) and submit the order.\
The `created` order will appear in the list of **"Terminal Orders"**. To view the order details click into the order on the list.
You can track the order via the **"Order Status"**. Once the order was submitted to Verifon the order status will change from `created` to `submitted`.
The order status will be `completed` when the order has been shipped.

### Provision Terminal Devices
If you bulk ordered terminal devices from JustiFi and want to provision them for specific sub accounts use the **"Provision Terminals"** button 
on the **"Terminal Orders"** tab instead. The provisioning process will preset the specified number of devices for the sub account. 
You will then need to ship the devices to the sub account.
