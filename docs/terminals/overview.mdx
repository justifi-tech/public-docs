# JustiFi Unified Card Present Solution

Justifi and Verifone have partnered to deliver industry-leading hardware, software, 
and terminal management to provide a trusted, end-to-end payment solution from two world-class providers.
Together, we’re redefining payments, ensuring frictionless transactions, increased revenue, 
and exceptional customer experiences.

Our unified card present solution brings both card not present and card present transactions 
into a single system. This not only simplifies processing but also streamlines reporting and support. 
By doing so, we offer platforms a smoother, more intuitive user experience while also making 
it easier to gain valuable insights and resolve issues. 
It's a win-win situation for platforms and their customers alike.

## Terminal Models
We offer a variety of terminal models. Here are the most commonly used ones:

### e285 - Companion Device or 3G Standalone 
Standalone mobile point of sale device with WiFi, Bluetooth and 3G communication options, 
allowing secure payment acceptance anywhere without dependence on a smart device. 
The solution features a color touch screen capable of signature capture and is built on the Verifone Engage platform,
enabling rich customer interaction at the point of sale.
