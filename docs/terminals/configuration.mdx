# Terminal Device Configuration

## Overview

Once you receive your terminal order you will need to connect the device(s) to Wifi and then enter the device ID (DID).\
You can find the device ID in the Welcome Email from Verifone and on the shipping list affixed to the terminal shipping box.\
Follow these steps to configure you device(s):

## After Configuration
You should be able to see any configured terminals in the [List Terminals API response](https://developer.justifi.ai/api-spec#tag/Terminals/operation/listTerminals) and in the 
**"Terminals List"** on the JustiFi dashboard. (Go to https://app.justifi.ai/ and choose **“Terminals”** from the **"Payments"** dropdown.)

## Check the Terminal Status
To double check that a terminal is in `CONNECTED` mode call the [Get Terminal Status API](https://developer.justifi.ai/api-spec#tag/Terminals/operation/getTerminalStatus) and pass the terminal ID. 
Or go to https://app.justifi.ai/ and choose **“Terminals”** from the **"Payments"** dropdown. On the detail view of a terminal click the **"Check Terminal Status"** button and the latest status will be retrieved. 

## Identify a Terminal
To ping a terminal device and display the nickname or serial number for 20 seconds on its display you can send a 
request to the [Identify Terminal API](https://docs.justifi.tech/api-spec#tag/Terminals/operation/postIdentifyTerminal).
Or go to https://app.justifi.ai/ and choose **“Terminals”** from the **"Payments"** dropdown. 
On the detail view of a terminal click **"Identify Terminal"**.  

## Reset a Terminal
A terminal is in `ACTIVE` mode when it is processing a payment and can sometimes get stuck. 
You can reset it by holding down the red **"X"**. Normally it will be in `CONNECTED` mode once it is reset.\
Once you have a device set up and confirmed it is in `CONNECTED` mode. At that point you can attempt a payment.

## FAQ
**Q:** How long will the Device ID screen wait before timeout?\
**A:** The Device ID timeout does not take effect when entering the Device ID. The DID will remain until the
form is completed, even after rebooting.

**Q:** What if I power down the device before entering DID?\
**A:** The terminal will return the device ID screen until the user enters the device ID.

**Q:** What if I do not enter DID and press OK?\
**A:** After pressing **"OK"**, the terminal will return to the Welcome screen. On the next reboot, it will display
the device ID entry screen.

**Q:** How long does it take to complete the software installation after entering the device ID?\
**A:** After the update job is scheduled by Verifone, it will take 15 to 20 minutes to complete. The download and
update usually are complete within 20 to 30 seconds.

**Q:** What if power is lost during the software installation process?\
**A:** The device will recover from the reboot and continue the software installation process.

**Q:** Are hidden WIFI networks supported?\
**A:** At this time, hidden networks will require engineering assistance.

**Q:** What if my device's battery charge level is low before I enter the DID?\
**A:** Please be sure the battery level is above 50% before entering DID. The device will postpone updates if
the battery is lower than 20%. It is best practice to attach the terminal to the AC power adapter during
the VHQ DID software update process.

**Q:** What if I cannot find the Welcome email for the terminal?\
**A:** If the welcome email is missing, check the packaging list affixed to the terminal's box. 
The DID is listed under “Reference” on the bottom of the packaging list.\
