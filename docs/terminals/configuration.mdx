# Terminal Device Configuration

## Overview

Once you receive your terminal order you will need to connect the device(s) to Wifi and enter the device ID. 
To do that, follow these steps: 

<!-- <Box> -->
<!--   <Flex display="flex" align-items="center" justify-content="center"> -->

    <img
      src={TerminalSetupGuide1}
      alt="terminal set up guide steps 1 to 6"
      object-fit="contain"
      width="100%"
      height="100%"
    />

    <img
      src={TerminalSetupGuide2}
      alt="terminal set up guide steps 7 to 11"
      object-fit="contain"
      width="100%"
      height="100%"
    />

    <img
      src={TerminalSetupGuide3}
      alt="terminal set up guide steps 12 to 17"
      object-fit="contain"
      width="100%"
      height="100%"
    />
<!--   </Flex> -->

## After Configuration
You should be able to see any configured terminals in the [List Terminals API response](https://developer.justifi.ai/api-spec#tag/Terminals/operation/listTerminals). 

## Check Terminal Status
To double check that a terminal is in “CONNECTED” mode call the [Get Terminal Status API](https://developer.justifi.ai/api-spec#tag/Terminals/operation/getTerminalStatus) and pass the terminal ID. 
Or go to https://app.justifi.ai/ and choose “Terminals” from the “Payments” dropdown. On the detail view of a terminal click the `Check Terminal Status` button and the latest status will be retrieved. 

## Identify a Terminal
To ping a terminal device and display the nickname or provider ID for 20 seconds on the device display you can send a request to the [Post Identify Terminal API](https://docs.justifi.tech/api-spec#tag/Terminals/operation/postIdentifyTerminal).

## Reset Terminal
A Terminal is in “ACTIVE” mode when it is processing a payment and can sometimes get stuck. You can reset it by holding down the red “X”, normally it will be in “CONNECTED” mode once it is reset.

Once you have a device set up and confirmed it is in “CONNECTED” mode you can attempt a payment.
