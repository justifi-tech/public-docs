# Terminal Device Configuration

## Overview

When you receive your terminal order you will need to connect the device(s) to Wifi and then enter the **device ID (DID**). 
You can find the 8 digit device ID(s) in the Welcome Email from Verifone and on the **"Terminals"** list in the JustiFi dashboard.\
To view the **"Terminals"** list go to https://app.justifi.ai/ and choose **“Terminals”** from the **"Payments"** dropdown.
Filter the list by sub account. Choose a device ID from the list of terminals that match the **"Model Name"** you want to configure 
and have no assigned **"Serial Number"**. The **"Serial Number"** will be assigned to the device after configuration is finished.

#### Follow these steps to configure your device(s):

## After Configuration
You should be able to see any configured terminals in the response of the [List Terminals API response](https://developer.justifi.ai/api-spec#tag/Terminals/operation/listTerminals) 
and in the **"Terminals List"** on the JustiFi dashboard:\
Go to https://app.justifi.ai/ and choose **“Terminals”** from the **"Payments"** dropdown. 
Confirm that the device you just configured has an assigned **"Serial Number"** that matches the serial number on the back of your device.

<!--
## Assign Nickname
To simplify identifying and handling a specific terminal device you can assign a nickname to it
as soon as the terminal order was created and anytime after. 
To do that use the [Update Terminal API](https://docs.justifi.tech/api-spec#tag/Terminals/operation/updateTerminal)
or edit the **"Nickname"** field on the **"Order Details"** page on the JustiFi dashboard.
The nickname can be changed at any time via the same methods.
-->

## Check Terminal Status
To double check that a terminal is in `CONNECTED` mode call the [Get Terminal Status API](https://developer.justifi.ai/api-spec#tag/Terminals/operation/getTerminalStatus) and pass the terminal ID. 
Or go to https://app.justifi.ai/ and choose **“Terminals”** from the **"Payments"** dropdown. On the **"Terminals"** list click into a terminal you want to check.
On the detail view of a terminal click the **"Check Terminal Status"** button and the latest status will be retrieved. 

## Identify Terminal
To ping a terminal device and display the nickname or serial number for 20 seconds on its display you can send a 
request to the [Identify Terminal API](https://docs.justifi.tech/api-spec#tag/Terminals/operation/postIdentifyTerminal).
Or go to https://app.justifi.ai/ and choose **“Terminals”** from the **"Payments"** dropdown. 
On the **"Terminals"** list click into a terminal you want to ping. 
On the detail view of a terminal click **"Identify Terminal"**.  

## Reset a Terminal
A terminal is in `ACTIVE` mode when it is processing a payment. It can occasionally get unresponsive. 
In this case you can reset it by holding down the red **"X"**. Once reset the device will usually be in `CONNECTED` mode.

Once your device is configured and you have confirmed it is in `CONNECTED` mode you can [attempt a payment](https://docs.justifi.tech/terminals/payment).

## FAQ
**How long will the Device ID screen wait before timeout?**\
The Device ID timeout does not take effect when entering the Device ID. The DID will remain until the
form is completed, even after rebooting.

**What if I power down the device before entering DID?**\
The terminal will return the device ID screen until the user enters the device ID.

**What if I do not enter DID and press OK?**\
After pressing **"OK"**, the terminal will return to the Welcome screen. On the next reboot, it will display
the device ID entry screen.

**How long does it take to complete the software installation after entering the device ID?**\
After the update job is scheduled by Verifone, it will take 15 to 20 minutes to complete. The download and
update usually are complete within 20 to 30 seconds.

**What if power is lost during the software installation process?**\
The device will recover from the reboot and continue the software installation process.

**Are hidden WIFI networks supported?**\
At this time, hidden networks will require engineering assistance.

**What if my device's battery charge level is low before I enter the DID?**\
Please be sure the battery level is above 50% before entering DID. The device will postpone updates if
the battery is lower than 20%. It is best practice to attach the terminal to the AC power adapter during
the VHQ DID software update process.

**What if I cannot find the Welcome email for the terminal?**\
If your package was sent from Verifone, check the packaging list affixed to the terminal's box. 
The 8 digit DID is listed under “Reference” on the bottom of the packaging list.\
If you can't find either or your package was not sent from Verifone please contact [JustiFi Customer Success](mailto:platform_success@justifi.tech).
