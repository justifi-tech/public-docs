# Testing Disputes

:::info Pre-Release Feature
This feature is currently in pre-release. API endpoints and functionality be adjusted before general availability.
:::

The JustiFi dispute system provides a comprehensive test environment that simulates the complete dispute lifecycle. This allows you to test your dispute handling workflows without affecting live data or moving real money.

## Creating Test Disputes

To create a dispute call the [create payment API](https://docs.justifi.tech/api-spec#tag/Payments/operation/CreatePayment) and pass the dispute_test_spec parameter in the metadata property as outlined below.
This will create a successful payment with an associated dispute.

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "dispute_test_spec": {
      "expected_result": "won",
      "reason": "fraudulent",
      "forfeit": false,
      "due_date": "2024-02-15",
      "event_publish_delay_in_seconds": 60
    }
  }
}
```

## Test Workflow

1. **Payment Creation**: A payment with `dispute_test_spec` key inside metadata
2. **Dispute Creation**: System creates dispute with `needs_response` status
3. **Response Building**: Test evidence upload and response field updates
5. **Resolution**: Dispute resolves based on your `expected_result` configuration after `event_publish_delay_in_seconds` seconds
6. **Webhook Events**: Receive all lifecycle events for testing

## Configuration Options

The following options are available to customize the dispute details and outcome.

### Expected Results
- **`won`** - Dispute resolves in your favor, funds returned
- **`lost`** - Dispute resolves against you, funds retained by platform

### Dispute Reasons
- `fraudulent` - Customer claims they didn't authorize the payment
- `unrecognized` - Customer doesn't recognize the transaction
- `duplicate` - Customer claims they were charged multiple times
- `subscription_canceled` - Customer claims they canceled their subscription
- `product_unacceptable` - Customer claims the product was defective
- `product_not_received` - Customer claims they never received the product
- `processing_error` - Customer claims there was a processing error
- `credit_not_processed` - Customer claims a refund wasn't processed
- `general` - General dispute reason
- `debit_not_authorized` - The debit was not authorized
- `incorrect_account` - The account is not correct

### Timing Configuration
- **`due_date`** - Response deadline in YYYY-MM-DD format (typically 7-10 business days)
- **`event_publish_delay_in_seconds`** - Delay before dispute creation event (default: 60)

## Testing Evidence Upload

To upload evidence for the dispute you can either use the [Dispute Management web component](https://storybook.justifi.ai/?path=/docs/payment-facilitation-dispute-management--docs) or the [create dispute evidence API](https://docs.justifi.tech/api-spec#tag/Disputes/operation/UpdateDispute) and submit [Dispute Response API](https://docs.justifi.tech/api-spec#tag/Disputes/operation/UpdateDisputeResponse)

## Testing Response Scenarios

### Comprehensive Response Example

```json
{
  "customer_name": "John Doe",
  "customer_email_address": "john@example.com",
  "customer_billing_address": "123 Main St, Anytown, ST 12345",
  "customer_purchase_ip_address": "192.168.1.1",
  "product_description": "Premium software subscription with advanced features",
  "service_date": "2024-01-15",
  "shipping_address": "123 Main St, Anytown, ST 12345",
  "shipping_carrier": "FedEx",
  "shipping_date": "2024-01-16",
  "shipping_tracking_number": "1234567890",
  "refund_policy_disclosure": "Customer agreed to no-refund policy during checkout",
  "additional_statement": "Customer received and actively used the service as confirmed by login logs and feature usage analytics."
}
```

### Testing Forfeiture

If you choose not to contest the dispute you should do `POST` request to `/disputes/{id}/response` with the following body:

```json
{
  "forfeit": true
}
```

## Status Flow Testing

Test each status transition:

1. **`needs_response`** - Initial status after dispute creation
3. **`under_review`** - Automatic after response submission
4. **`won`** or **`lost`** - Based on `expected_result` configuration

## Webhook Testing

Test disputes generate all standard webhook events:

- **`payment.dispute.created`** - Lets you know anytime a customer opens a payment dispute
- **`payment.dispute.closed`** - Lets you know anytime a payment dispute is closed
- **`payment.dispute.funds_returned`** - Lets you know anytime a payment dispute won and funds are returned
- **`payment.dispute_evidence.created`** - Lets you know anytime a dispute evidence is created
- **`payment.dispute_evidence.uploaded`** - Lets you know anytime a dispute evidence is uploaded
- **`payment.dispute.forfeited`** - Lets you know anytime a dispute response is forfeited
- **`payment.dispute.submitted`** - Lets you know anytime a dispute response is submitted

Configure webhook endpoints in your test account to receive and process these events.
