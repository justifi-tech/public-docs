# Testing JustiFi Integration
This guide explains how to test various payment scenarios when integrating with JustiFi's 
payment processing system. By using specific test scenarios in your API requests, you can 
simulate different payment outcomes without processing real transactions.

## Overview
JustiFi provides a comprehensive testing framework that allows you to simulate various payment 
scenarios including successful payments, card declines, gateway errors, and other edge cases. 
This helps you build robust error handling and ensure your integration works 
correctly in all situations.

## How Testing Works
To trigger specific test scenarios, include a metadata field in your payment requests with the following structure:
```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "payment_test": {
      "scenario": "scenario_name"
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `scenario_name` with one of the available test scenarios listed in each resource specific section in the sidebar


### Best Practices for Testing

- Test All Scenarios: Ensure your application handles each type of error appropriately
- Error Message Display: Test how error messages are displayed to end users
- Retry Logic: Implement and test appropriate retry logic for different error types
- Logging: Verify that errors are logged properly for debugging
- User Experience: Test the complete user flow for both successful and failed payments

### Next Steps
Once you've thoroughly tested your integration using these scenarios, you'll be ready to process live payments. Remember to remove or modify any test scenario metadata when moving to production.
