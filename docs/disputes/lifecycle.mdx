# Dispute Lifecycle

## Dispute Creation

A dispute (also known as chargeback) is created when a cardholder contacts their card issuer to question a payment.
The card issuer opens a chargeback and returns the questioned funds to the cardholder.
JustiFi is notified of the chargeback, creates a dispute associated with the payment and pulls the payment funds (and a dispute fee) back from the merchant.
As soon as JustiFi has created the dispute:

1. **Notification**: You receive a `payment.dispute.created` webhook event
2. **Timeline**: You have 7-10 business days to respond (varies by card network)

## Response Phase

### Building Your Response

During the response phase, you can:

- **Upload Evidence**: Add supporting documents via the create [dispute evidence API](https://docs.justifi.tech/api-spec#tag/Disputes/operation/GetDispute) or via [Dispute Management web component](https://storybook.justifi.ai/?path=/docs/payment-facilitation-dispute-management--docs)
- **Update Response Fields**: Fill in detailed information about the transaction

### File Requirements

## Submission and Review

### Forfeiture Option

If you choose not to contest the dispute either use the [submit dispute response API](https://docs.justifi.tech/api-spec#tag/Disputes/operation/SubmitDisputeResponse) with the following body:

```json
{
  "forfeit": true
}
```

Or instead forfeit the dispute via [Dispute Management web component](https://storybook.justifi.ai/?path=/docs/payment-facilitation-dispute-management--docs).

This immediately transitions the dispute to `lost` status.

## Resolution Phase

### Possible Outcomes

#### Won (`won` status)
- **Funds Returned**: Disputed amount returned to your merchant's account.
- **Notification**: `payment.dispute.closed` webhook event

#### Lost (`lost` status)
- **Funds Retained**: No funds are moved.
- **Notification**: `payment.dispute.closed` webhook event

### Dispute Reversals

Card networks can reverse lost disputes:

1. **Reversal Trigger**: New evidence or network decision
2. **Dispute updated**: Status of dispute is updated to won
3. **Fund Return**: Previously lost funds are returned
4. **Notification**: `payment.dispute.closed` webhook event

## Status Transitions

```
needs_response → under_review → won/lost
                              ↓
                          forfeited
```

### Status Descriptions

- **`needs_response`** - Initial status, response deadline active
- **`under_review`** - Response submitted, card network is reviewing
- **`won`** - Dispute resolved in merchant's favor
- **`lost`** - Dispute resolved against the merchant
