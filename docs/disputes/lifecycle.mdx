# Dispute Lifecycle

Understanding the dispute lifecycle is crucial for effective dispute management. This guide covers each stage of the process and the actions you can take at each step.

## Dispute Creation

Disputes are created when a cardholder contacts their card issuer to question a payment. When this happens:

1. **Notification**: You receive a `dispute_created` webhook event
2. **Timeline**: You have 7-10 business days to respond (varies by card network)

## Response Phase

### Building Your Response

During the response phase, you can:

- **Upload Evidence**: Add supporting documents via the evidence API
- **Update Response Fields**: Fill in detailed information about the transaction

### Response Fields

Provide comprehensive information across these categories:

#### Customer Information
- `customer_name` - Full customer name
- `customer_email_address` - Customer email
- `customer_billing_address` - Billing address
- `customer_purchase_ip_address` - IP address at purchase time

#### Transaction Details
- `product_description` - Detailed product/service description
- `service_date` - Date service was provided
- `duplicate_charge_original_payment_id` - Reference for duplicate charges
- `duplicate_charge_explanation` - Explanation for duplicate charges

#### Shipping Information
- `shipping_address` - Delivery address
- `shipping_carrier` - Shipping company
- `shipping_date` - Ship date
- `shipping_tracking_number` - Tracking number

#### Policy Information
- `refund_policy_disclosure` - Refund policy terms
- `cancellation_policy_disclosure` - Cancellation policy terms
- `refund_refusal_explanation` - Why refund was refused
- `cancellation_rebuttal` - Response to cancellation claims

#### Additional Context
- `additional_statement` - Free-form additional information

## Evidence Management

### Evidence Categories

Choose appropriate categories for maximum impact:

| Category | Best Used For |
|----------|---------------|
| `receipt` | Purchase confirmations, invoices |
| `shipping_documentation` | Delivery proof, tracking info |
| `customer_communication` | Email exchanges, support tickets |
| `customer_signature` | Signed delivery receipts |
| `refund_policy` | Terms of service, policies |
| `cancellation_policy` | Cancellation terms |
| `service_documentation` | Proof of service delivery |
| `duplicate_charge_documentation` | Duplicate charge evidence |
| `activity_log` | System logs, usage data |
| `uncategorized_file` | Other supporting documents |

### File Requirements

- **Supported formats**: PDF, JPG, JPEG, PNG, ZIP
- **Validation**: File extension must match MIME type

## Submission and Review

### Forfeiture Option

If you choose not to contest the dispute you should do `POST` request to `/disputes/{id}/response` with the following body:

```json
{
  forfeit: true
}
```

This immediately transitions the dispute to `lost` status.

## Resolution Phase

### Possible Outcomes

#### Won (`won` status)
- **Funds Returned**: Disputed amount returned to your account
- **Notification**: `dispute_resolved` and `dispute_funds_returned` webhook events

#### Lost (`lost` status)
- **Funds Retained**: Platform keeps the disputed amount
- **Notification**: `dispute_resolved` webhook event

### Dispute Reversals

Card networks can reverse lost disputes:

1. **Reversal Trigger**: New evidence or network decision
3. **Fund Return**: Previously lost funds are returned
4. **Notification**: `dispute_reversed` webhook event

## Status Transitions

```
needs_response → warning_needs_response → under_review → won/lost
                                      ↓
                                   forfeited
```

### Status Descriptions

- **`needs_response`** - Initial status, response deadline active
- **`warning_needs_response`** - Near deadline warning (typically 1-2 days remaining)
- **`under_review`** - Response submitted, card network reviewing
- **`won`** - Dispute resolved in your favor
- **`lost`** - Dispute resolved against you

## Webhook Events

Monitor these events for real-time updates:

- **`dispute_created`** - New dispute received
- **`dispute_resolved`** - Final outcome determined
- **`dispute_funds_returned`** - Funds returned for won dispute
- **`dispute_reversed`** - Lost dispute reversed
