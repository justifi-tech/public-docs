# Authentication While Using JustiFi's API

Secure and efficient access to JustiFi's API is paramount. We use OAuth2 authentication, a
standard protocol for authorization, and secure your API requests with Bearer tokens for robust
protection.

[API Specification](https://docs.justifi.tech/api-spec#tag/API-Credentials/operation/CreateAccessToken)

## OAuth2 and Bearer Token Authentication

OAuth2 provides a secure and standardized way to authorize API requests. When you access JustiFi's
API, your request must include a Bearer token, which is a unique token obtained after a successful
OAuth2 authentication process. This token ensures that your interactions with our API are secure
and authenticated.

## Obtaining Your API Key

To start using our API, you'll need an API Key, which you can obtain from our customer dashboard.
This key is essential for the OAuth2 authentication process.

### Steps to Get Your API Key:

1. **Access the Customer Dashboard:** Log in to your JustiFi [account](https://app.justifi.ai).
2. **Navigate to the Developer Section:** Find the API section where you can manage your keys.
3. **Continue to the API Keys Section:** Follow the steps to generate a new API key.

## Create Your Bearer Token

Once you have your API Key, you'll use it to obtain a Bearer token. Here's an example to generate
an Authentication Token. You can replace the `client_id` and `client_secret` to use your
own. **Be sure to use TEST keys!**

<!-- <OpenApiTryIt -->
<!--     definitionId="justifi" -->
<!--     operationId="CreateAccessToken" -->
<!--     id="step-1" -->
<!--     properties={{ -->
<!--         client_id: "abc", -->
<!--         client_secret: "secret", -->
<!--     }} -->
<!--     paramaters={{ -->
<!--         header: {} -->
<!--     }} -->
