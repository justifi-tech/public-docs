# Pagination in JustiFi API

Effective management of large datasets is crucial in API interactions. JustiFi's API employs
cursor-based pagination, ensuring efficient and scalable data retrieval for bulk fetches.

## Cursor-Based Pagination Explained

Cursor-based pagination involves navigating through data using cursor pointers
(`before_cursor` and `after_cursor`), making it ideal for handling extensive datasets. Each
response in our API includes a `page_info` object, crucial for understanding your position in
the data set and managing the flow of information.

### Using the Page Info Object:

- **Navigation Fields:** The `page_info` object contains `has_next` and `has_previous` fields
  to indicate more available items.
- **Cursor Values:** `start_cursor` and `end_cursor` are included for precise data retrieval.

## API Request Parameters

When fetching data, these parameters are key:

- **`limit`:** Controls the number of resources retrieved per request. It can range from 1 to
  100, with a default value of 25.
- **`after_cursor`:** Fetches the next page of data.
- **`before_cursor`:** Retrieves the previous page of data.

### Standard Response Structure

All responses follow a consistent structure:

- **`id`:** The ID of the object returned, null for array responses.
- **`type`:** Indicates the type of object returned, typically an "array" for bulk fetches.
- **`data`:** Contains the requested resource(s) or an empty array if no resources are
  available.
- **`page_info`:** Provides pagination details, including cursor positions.

##### Example Paginated Request

```sh
curl -X GET https://api.justifi.ai/v1/payments?limit=25&after_cursor=token-from-page-info \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer [access_token]' \
    -H 'Accept: application/json'
```

##### Example Paginated Response

```sh
{
    "id": null,
    "type": "array",
    "data":[
        { "id":"py_438xBom2Drh55kE1WfyGLg",
          "amount": 1000,
          ... additional response attributes based on resource schema
        }
    ],
    "page_info": {
      "has_previous": false,
      "has_next": true,
      "start_cursor": "WyIyMDIyLTAxLTExIDE1OjI3OjM2LjAyNzc3MDAwMCIsImNhNjQwMTk1LTEzYzMtNGJlZi1hZWQyLTU3ZjA1MzhjNjNiYSJd",
      "end_cursor": "WyIyMDIyLTAxLTExIDEyOjU5OjQwLjAwNTkxODAwMCIsImQ0Njg5MGE2LTJhZDItNGZjNy1iNzdkLWFiNmE3MDJhNTg3YSJd"
    }
}
```

## Best Practices for Pagination

- **Determine Optimal Page Size:** Balance performance and usability by setting an appropriate
  `limit`.
- **Consistent Cursor Usage:** Utilize `before_cursor` and `after_cursor` effectively for
  predictable navigation.
- **Understand Response Structure:** Familiarize yourself with the standard response envelope
  for efficient data handling.

By leveraging JustiFi's pagination system, you can efficiently navigate through large datasets,
ensuring your application remains responsive and data retrieval remains manageable.
