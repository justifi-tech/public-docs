# Understanding Idempotency in JustiFi API

Idempotency is a fundamental concept in API design, especially when dealing with critical
operations like financial transactions. At JustiFi, we ensure the reliability and consistency of
transactions through idempotent requests.

## What is Idempotency?

Idempotency in API terms means that making multiple identical requests results in the same
outcome as making a single request. This is particularly important for financial
transactions, where the risk of duplicate processing needs to be eliminated.

## Implementing Idempotency with JustiFi's APIs

To achieve idempotency, JustiFi leverages the `Idempotency-Key` header in our payment APIs.

### The Idempotency-Key Header

:::warning
Failing to provide an `Idempotency-Key` will exclude your requests from the protections described.
:::

- **Optional Usage:** Each request may include an `Idempotency-Key` header.
- **Preventing Duplicates:** If a second request with the same idempotent key is processed
  concurrently, it will return a 409 error, preventing double processing.
- **Error Handling:**
  - **Network Timeouts and 5XX Errors:** Retry these requests with the exact same parameters
    and idempotency key.
  - **2XX Responses:** Indicate successful processing. Repeating an identical request with the same key
    will return the original response.
  - **4XX Errors (Except 409):** Do not retry these requests as they indicate client-side
    errors.

### Choosing an Idempotency-Key

- **String Identifier:** You can use any string as your `Idempotency-Key`. We recommend using
  a UUID for uniqueness, but any distinctive string (100 character max) that identifies the transaction will work.

### Idempotency Key Constraints

- **Uniqueness Per Transaction:** The key should be unique to each transaction. Using the same
  key with different parameters will result in an error.
- **Single Transaction Use:** The key is intended to safeguard a single transaction. Altering
  the request parameters makes it a distinct request, requiring a new idempotency key.

## Best Practices

- **Generate Unique Keys:** Ensure each key is unique to prevent unintended conflicts.
- **Consistent Parameters:** Use the same parameters when retrying requests to maintain
  idempotency.
- **Error Code Awareness:** Understand the error codes to determine when it's appropriate to
  retry a request.

By adhering to these guidelines and effectively utilizing the `Idempotency-Key` header, you can
ensure that your transactions via JustiFi's API are processed reliably and consistently,
without the risk of duplication.
