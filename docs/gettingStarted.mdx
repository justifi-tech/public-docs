# Getting Started with JustiFi

Welcome to JustiFi,where we empower software companies to transform into trailblazing Fintech leaders.
Our suite of Fintech products is designed to seamlessly integrate financial technology into your offerings and opening new horizons in the fintech world.\

This guide will walk you through the essential steps to integrate JustiFi's Fintech products into your platform.

## Overview

JustiFi provides a complete payment infrastructure solution that enables platforms to:
- Onboard and underwrite merchants (sub accounts)
- Process merchants' payments through multiple channels
- Manage merchant payouts and platform earnings
- Provide comprehensive reporting and analytics

## Prerequisites

Before you begin integration, ensure you have:

### 1. JustiFi Dashboard Access
- Login credentials provided by your Customer Success representative
- Access the dashboard at [https://app.justifi.ai](https://app.justifi.ai/)

### 2. API Credentials
To generate your API credentials:
1. Log into the JustiFi dashboard
2. Navigate to **Developers**
3. Toggle **Test Mode** ON for sandbox environment testing
4. Go to **API Keys** and create a test API key
5. Store your API key securely - it determines your environment (test/production)

### 3. Environment Setup
- **Test Environment**: Use test API keys for development and testing
- **Production Environment**: Use production API keys for live transactions
- The API key environment automatically routes your requests to the correct environment

## Quick Start Integration

### Step 1: Generate Access Token

All API requests require an access token. Generate one using your API credentials:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.justifi.ai/oauth/token \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "client_id": "YOUR_API_KEY",
    "client_secret": "YOUR_API_SECRET",
    "grant_type": "client_credentials"
  }'
```

Include the access token in all subsequent API requests:
```bash
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
```
For details see [Geting Started](https://docs.justifi.tech/api-spec#section/Getting-Started)

### Step 2: Create a Business

Start by creating a business entity for your merchant:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.justifi.ai/v1/entities/business \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "legal_name": "Example Business LLC",
    "doing_business_as": "Example Store",
    "business_type": "limited_liability_company",
    "business_structure": "single_member",
    "industry": "retail",
    "tax_id": "12-3456789"
  }'
```

Save the returned `business_id` - you'll need it for the next steps.

### Step 3: Complete Merchant Onboarding via Hosted Onboarding
1. Direct merchants to the hosted onboarding URL with their business ID
2. JustiFi handles all compliance and underwriting requirements
3. Listen for webhook events to track onboarding status


### Step 4: Process Your First Payment

Once your merchant is approved (typically 1-2 business days), you can start processing payments:

#### Using Hosted Checkout:
```bash
curl -X POST https://api.justifi.ai/v1/checkouts \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "sub_account_id": "sa_123",
    "amount": 1000,
    "currency": "usd",
    "description": "Test payment"
  }'
```

Redirect customers to the returned `checkout_url`.
