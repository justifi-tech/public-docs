## Checkout abstraction

Checkout API provides access to multiple products and features from the JustiFi platform using a single API.
By orchestrating multiple backend resources, it enables seamless payment collection, integration
with terminal readers, BNPL transactions, insurance quote processing, and more in a unified flow.

### Key Benefits

- **Abstraction:** Checkout gives access to multiple fintech products (beyond payments).
- **Traceability:** Each attempt to complete the checkout is recorded, ensuring traceability and
  status tracking for every checkout.
- **Implementation:** Simplified setup with a single API and web component.

## Checkout Web Component

Web components are encapsulated, self-contained units of code (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript),
that can be easily reused and combined with other components without external code interference.
This leads to more consistent user interfaces, streamlined development, and reduced maintenance,
as updates to a component automatically apply across all instances.

The Checkout Web Component provides the easiest way for customers to access multiple fintech products.
