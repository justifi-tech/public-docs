# Hosted Checkout

Hosted Checkout is the quickest and easiest way to use JustiFi checkouts without the need to build a user interface. Once a checkout is created via API, a link to that checkout can be shared and will take the user to a JustiFi hosted checkout solution.

**Note:** JustiFi checkouts expire after 1 week. Please keep this in mind when generating and sharing links to hosted checkouts.

## Getting Started

First, create a checkout following our [Create a Checkout API documentation](https://docs.justifi.tech/api-spec#tag/Checkouts/operation/CreateCheckout).

Upon successful checkout creation, use the checkout ID from the response to create a hosted checkout link:

```components.justifi.ai/checkout/:checkoutId```

## Custom Redirects

By default JustiFi Hosted Checkout redirects to a generic `Checkout Complete` page after successful checkout or a `Checkout Session Expired` page if the checkout has expired. If the desired behavior is to redirect back to your application upon completion of the checkout, you can use the `success_redirect_url` parameter to override the default redirect:
```components.justifi.ai/checkout/chk_abc123def456?success_redirect_url=https://yourapp.com/payment-success```
