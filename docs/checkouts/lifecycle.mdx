# Lifecycle

## Overview

A Checkout is not a Payment; it has its own data model, lifecycle, and statuses.
It contains the information necessary to prepare for possibly multiple payment transactions.
During checkout completion a payment is created, processed and linked to the checkout.

### Diagram

- When a Checkout is created its status is set to `created`.
- If a payment attempt fails, it transitions to the status `attempted`
  and remains there until it either expires or a payment is successful.
- If a payment succeeds, it transitions to the status `completed`.
- If not completed within 1 week, it automatically transitions to the status `expired`.
- A checkout can have multiple failed payment attempts and/or 1 succeeded payment attempt -
  see [Checkout Completion Attribute](lifecycle/#checkout-completion-attribute).

### Datamodel

- A checkout has its own attributes set at creation and can be updated if not completed or expired.
- Use the [Get Checkout API](https://docs.justifi.tech/api-spec#tag/Checkouts/operation/GetCheckout)
  to check the current Checkout state, as in the following example:

```json
{
  "id": "cho_xyz",
  "type": "checkout",
  "data": {
    "id": "cho_xyz",
    "account_id": "acc_xyz",
    "platform_account_id": "acc_xyz",
    "payment_amount": 10000,
    "payment_currency": "usd",
    "payment_description": "my_order_xyz",
    "payment_methods": [],
    "payment_method_group_id": "pmg_xyz",
    "status": "created",
    "mode": "test",
    "successful_payment_id": "py_xyz",
    "statement_descriptor": "Big Business",
    "payment_fees": [
      { "type": "processing_fee", "amount": 295 },
      { "type": "platform_fee", "amount": 150 }
    ],
    "payment_settings": {},
    "created_at": "2024-01-01T12:00:00Z",
    "updated_at": "2024-01-01T12:00:00Z"
  },
  "page_info": "string"
}
```

:::note Currency
The `payment_currency` field reflects the currency of the sub-account processing the checkout (e.g., `usd` or `cad`). Sub-accounts are scoped to a single currency. To process checkouts in CAD, you need a dedicated Canada platform account.
:::

:::note Fee Structure
The `payment_fees` array contains fee objects specifying the fees to be applied when the checkout is completed. Each fee has a `type` (`processing_fee` or `platform_fee`) and an `amount` in cents. See [Fees documentation](/checkouts/features#fees) for more details.

### Checkout Completion Attribute

- Each attempt to complete a checkout with one of the available payment options
  is recorded in the `completions` attribute.
- The Checkout completion attribute serves as a **history/log** of all completion attempts,
  including failed attempts and any successful payment.
- **Important:** This history is never updated, even if a payment has been refunded.
