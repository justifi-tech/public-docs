# Features

## Overview

Checkouts offer consolidated payment collection,
payment method tokenization into groups,
and customizable application fees in a single workflow.
Supported payment types include Card Payments, ACH Payments,
Insurance Quote Payments, BNPL (Buy Now Pay Later) Payments (API support pending),
and Terminal (Card Reader) Payments.

_note: New features will be documented here as they become available._

### Card and ACH Payment

- To process a card or ACH payment through this API, refer to [Checkout via API](https://docs.justifi.tech/api-spec#tag/Checkout-via-API)
- To process a card or ACH payment using the Unified Fintech Checkout™ Component, refer to [Checkout via Component](https://docs.justifi.tech/api-spec#tag/Checkout-via-Component)

### Insurance Quote Payments

- To include an insurance quote in a Checkout, first contact [customer_success@justifi.tech](mailto:customer_success@justifi.tech)
  to enable insurance payments for your platform. Ensure the required insurance type is available through our provider.
- After creating a Checkout, use the [Unified Fintech Checkout™ Component with insurance](https://storybook.justifi.ai/?path=/story/payment-facilitation-unified-fintech-checkout%E2%84%A2--checkout-insurance)
  to collect the insurance payment.

### BNPL Payments

- To enable BNPL payments, contact [customer_success@justifi.tech](mailto:customer_success@justifi.tech)
  to activate BNPL for your platform and sub account.
- After creating a Checkout, use the [Unified Fintech Checkout™ Component](https://storybook.justifi.ai/?path=/story/payment-facilitation-unified-fintech-checkout%E2%84%A2--example)
  with the BNPL option (default).

_note: Disable the BNPL option by passing the correspondent prop to the web component:
[disable-bnpl](https://storybook.justifi.ai/?path=/docs/payment-facilitation-unified-fintech-checkout%E2%84%A2--docs)_

### Terminal (Card Reader) Payments

- For terminal payments, contact [customer_success@justifi.tech](mailto:customer_success@justifi.tech)
  to enable the card-present feature. JustiFi will then provision and configure terminals for your sub accounts.
- Find detailed steps in the [Terminals API](https://docs.justifi.tech/api-spec#tag/Terminals)

### Application Fees

- Application Fees are configured at the Platform level and can be customized for specific sub accounts.
  Checkouts add an additional layer of flexibility by allowing the use of the `application_fees` parameter
  when creating a checkout.

- **Create a Checkout:** Use the [Create Checkout API](https://docs.justifi.tech/api-spec#tag/Checkouts)
   with custom application fees (in cents) for card and bank payments, as in the following example:

```json
{
   "amount": 1000,
   "description": "test checkout application fees",
   "application_fees": {
      "card": {
         "amount": "200"
      },
      "bank_account": {
         "amount": "100"
      }
   }
}
```

- The application fee applies based on the selected payment method during checkout.
  It overwrites the `application_fee_rate` set for the platform and/or sub account.
  _note: available for Card, ACH and Terminal (Card Present) only!_

### Payment Method Group

- **Create a Payment Method Group:** Use the [Payment Method Group API](https://docs.justifi.tech/api-spec#tag/Payment-Method-Groups)
  to create a group for easy payment method access.
- **Create a Checkout:** Use the [Create Checkout API](https://docs.justifi.tech/api-spec#tag/Checkouts/operation/CreateCheckout)
  and pass the `payment_method_group_id`.
- **Checkout Web Component:** Use the [Unified Fintech Checkout™ Component](https://storybook.justifi.ai/?path=/docs/payment-facilitation-unified-fintech-checkout%E2%84%A2--docs)
  with the created checkout. This allows the component to display a list of tokenized payment methods
  in the group, and an option to **Save new payment method** is also available.
