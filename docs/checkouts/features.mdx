# Features

## Overview

Checkouts offer consolidated payment collection,
payment method tokenization into groups,
and customizable application fees in a single workflow.
Supported payment types include Card Payments, ACH Payments,
Insurance Quote Payments, BNPL (Buy Now Pay Later) Payments (API support pending),
and Terminal (Card Reader) Payments.

_note: New features will be documented here as they become available._

:::note Currency Support
Checkouts support both USD and CAD currencies. The currency is determined by the sub-account processing the checkout — each sub-account is scoped to a single currency. To process checkouts in CAD, a dedicated Canada platform account is required.
:::

### Card and ACH Payment

- To process a card or ACH payment through this API, refer to [Checkout via API](https://docs.justifi.tech/api-spec#tag/Checkout-via-API)
- To process a card or ACH payment using the Unified Fintech Checkout™ Component, refer to [Checkout via Component](https://docs.justifi.tech/api-spec#tag/Checkout-via-Component)

### Insurance Quote Payments

- To include an insurance quote in a Checkout, first contact [customer_success@justifi.tech](mailto:customer_success@justifi.tech)
  to enable insurance payments for your platform. Ensure the required insurance type is available through our provider.
- After creating a Checkout, use the [Unified Fintech Checkout™ Component with insurance](/web-components/payment-facilitation/unified-fintech-checkout%E2%84%A2)
  to collect the insurance payment.

### BNPL Payments

- To enable BNPL payments, contact [customer_success@justifi.tech](mailto:customer_success@justifi.tech)
  to activate BNPL for your platform and sub account.
- After creating a Checkout, use the [Unified Fintech Checkout™ Component](/web-components/payment-facilitation/unified-fintech-checkout%E2%84%A2)
  with the BNPL option (default).

_note: Disable the BNPL option by passing the correspondent prop to the web component:
[disable-bnpl](/web-components/payment-facilitation/unified-fintech-checkout%E2%84%A2)_

### Terminal (Card Reader) Payments

- For terminal payments, contact [customer_success@justifi.tech](mailto:customer_success@justifi.tech)
  to enable the card-present feature. JustiFi will then provision and configure terminals for your sub accounts.
- Find detailed steps in the [Terminals API](https://docs.justifi.tech/api-spec#tag/Terminals)

### Fees

Checkouts support flexible fee structures that allow you to specify different fee types.
This enables transparent reporting for merchants and selective fee refunds.

#### Using the Fees Array (Recommended)

Use the `payment.fees` parameter to specify fee types when creating a checkout:

```json
{
  "amount": 10000,
  "description": "order_xyz",
  "payment": {
    "fees": [
      { "type": "processing_fee", "amount": 295 },
      { "type": "platform_fee", "amount": 150 }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Supported fee types:**
- `processing_fee` - Fees related to payment processing costs
- `platform_fee` - Fees for your platform's services

**Benefits of using the fees array:**
- **Transparent reporting**: Each fee type appears as a separate line item in merchant balance transactions
- **Selective refunds**: When processing refunds, you can choose which fees to return to the merchant

For full documentation, see [Enhanced Fee Management](https://docs.justifi.tech/api-spec#section/Enhanced-Fee-Management).

#### Application Fees

:::info For Existing Integrations
The `application_fees` parameter continues to work for existing integrations. **New integrations** should use `payment.fees` instead for selective refund support.
:::

- Application Fees are configured at the Platform level and can be customized for specific sub accounts.
  Checkouts add an additional layer of flexibility by allowing the use of the `application_fees` parameter
  when creating a checkout.

- **Create a Checkout:** Use the [Create Checkout API](https://docs.justifi.tech/api-spec#tag/Checkouts)
  with custom application fees (in cents) for card and bank payments, as in the following example:

```json
{
  "amount": 1000,
  "description": "test checkout application fees",
  "application_fees": {
    "card": {
      "amount": "200"
    },
    "bank_account": {
      "amount": "100"
    }
  }
}
```

- The application fee applies based on the selected payment method during checkout.
  It overwrites the `application_fee_rate` set for the sub account.
  _note: available for Card, ACH and Terminal (Card Present) only!_

**Important**: You cannot use both `application_fees` and `fees` in the same request.

### Payment Method Group

- **Create a Payment Method Group:** Use the [Payment Method Group API](https://docs.justifi.tech/api-spec#tag/Payment-Method-Groups)
  to create a group for easy payment method access.
- **Create a Checkout:** Use the [Create Checkout API](https://docs.justifi.tech/api-spec#tag/Checkouts/operation/CreateCheckout)
  and pass the `payment_method_group_id`.
- **Checkout Web Component:** Use the [Unified Fintech Checkout™ Component](/web-components/payment-facilitation/unified-fintech-checkout%E2%84%A2)
  and pass the checkout id. This allows the component to display a list of tokenized payment methods
  in the group, and an option to **Save new payment method** is also available.
