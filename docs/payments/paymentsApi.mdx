### Compliance Adherence

- **Understanding PCI Scope:** Be aware that directly transmitting PCI data (such as credit card
  information) to the JustiFi API may place your application within the scope of PCI compliance.
  This means you will need to ensure that your system adheres to PCI standards, which could involve
  additional security measures and validations.

  > **Important:** While JustiFi ensures the highest level of security and compliance in its
  > infrastructure, the way you handle and transmit payment data can affect your own PCI compliance
  > requirements. We recommend consulting with a PCI compliance expert to understand the implications
  > for your specific application.

By following these best practices, you can effectively use the JustiFi Payments API, ensuring
secure, efficient, and compliant financial transactions.
