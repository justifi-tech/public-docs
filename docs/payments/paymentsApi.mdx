# Payments API

## Overview

The JustiFi Payments API is a robust and versatile tool designed to streamline your payment
processing. This API facilitates various types of transactions, offering flexibility, security,
and ease of integration.

## Capabilities of the Payments API

### Transaction Processing

- **Direct Payments:** Process immediate transactions using various payment methods.
- **Payment Authorization:** Authorize payments and capture them at a later time, providing
  flexibility in transaction handling.

### Payment Management

- **Refunds and Cancellations:** Manage transaction reversals efficiently.
- **Transaction History:** Retrieve historical transaction data for record-keeping and analysis.

## Creating Payments

Payment methods must be tokenized before creating a payment. Use the
**[JustiFi Tokenize Payment Method Web Component](https://docs.justifi.tech/web-components/payment-facilitation/tokenize-payment-method)** to securely collect and tokenize
card or bank account details. The web component returns a payment method token that you can pass
to the Create Payment endpoint.

```
POST /v1/payments
{
  "amount": 1000,
  "currency": "usd",
  "capture_strategy": "automatic",
  "payment_method": {
    "token": "pm_justifi123"
  }
}
```

> **Note:** Passing raw card or bank account details directly to the Payments API requires prior
> approval. Contact [JustiFi Customer Success](mailto:customer_success@justifi.tech) if you have a use case that requires direct PAN submission.
> At minimum, a completed SAQ (Self-Assessment Questionnaire) is required to allow raw PAN submissions.

## Integrating the Payments API

### Getting Started

- **API Keys:** Learn how to obtain and use your API keys for secure interactions with the API.
- **Endpoint Details:** Overview of the primary endpoints for transaction processing, refunds, and
  more.

### Making API Calls

- **Request Format:** Guidelines on structuring API requests, including required and optional
  parameters.
- **Response Handling:** Understanding the API's response structure and how to interpret different
  response codes.

## Best Practices

### Compliance Adherence

- **Reduced PCI Scope:** By using [JustiFi's Tokenize Payment Method Web Component](https://docs.justifi.tech/web-components/payment-facilitation/tokenize-payment-method) 
  to tokenize payment method
  details, your application avoids directly handling PCI-scoped data like card numbers and bank
  account numbers. This significantly reduces your PCI compliance burden.

  > **Important:** If you have prior approval to pass raw payment method details directly to the API,
  > be aware that this places your application within the scope of PCI compliance. At minimum, a
  > completed SAQ (Self-Assessment Questionnaire) is required.

By following these best practices, you can effectively use the JustiFi Payments API, ensuring
secure, efficient, and compliant financial transactions.
