# Understanding PCI-DSS Compliance with JustiFi API

## Disclaimer

This document offers guidance on PCI-DSS compliance in the context of using JustiFi's API and web
components. It is intended for informational purposes and not as legal advice. Consult with your
legal or compliance team for specific advice with your business in mind.

## Overview of PCI-DSS

The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS) is a set of security standards designed
to ensure that all companies that accept, process, store, or transmit credit card information
maintain a secure environment. This compliance is crucial for protecting cardholder data and
maintaining customer trust.

## Levels of PCI Compliance

There are four levels of PCI compliance, primarily determined by the volume of transactions
processed annually. Each level has specific assessment and reporting requirements, with Level 1
being the most stringent.

| Level | Thresholds                                                             | Requirements                                                                      |
| ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | Merchants processing greater than 6 million card transactions per year | External audit performed by a Qualified Security Assessor (QSA)                   |
| 2     | Merchants processing 1 to 6 million transactions per year              | Must submit a Report of Compliance (ROC) completed by and internal evaluation     |
| 3     | Merchants handling 20,000 to 1 million transactions per year           | Not required to perform a ROC, but often do to promote their compliance adherence |
| 4     | Merchants handling fewer than 20,000 transactions per year             | Not required to provide audits                                                    |

## JustiFi's PCI Compliance

JustiFi maintains strict compliance with PCI-DSS Level 1 standards. Our infrastructure and services are
designed to secure sensitive payment data, leveraging advanced technologies like tokenization, encrypted transmission,
and encrypted storage to ensure the highest level of security.

## Specifics of Data Handling

JustiFi ensures secure data handling by:

- **Tokenization:** Replacing sensitive card details with unique tokens.
- **Secure Transmission:** Utilizing encrypted channels for data transfer.
- **Annual PCI-DSS Level 1 Audit:** Attestation of Compliance is available for customers to review upon request.
- **Quarterly AVS Scans:** Completed by independent and respected auditors.
- **Regular Penetration Testing:** Performed by established experts in the field.

## JustiFi's Role in Your Compliance

JustiFi aids in supporting your PCI-DSS compliance when you use our Card Form and Payment Form
Web Components. These tools use iFrames hosted on JustiFi's infrastructure, ensuring that sensitive
card data never passes directly through your application. This approach is widely recognized as a
method to potentially avoid entering PCI-DSS scope.

## Your Responsibilities

If you choose to collect card data directly and pass it to JustiFi using our Payment API or by
creating Card Payment Methods, the card data will be traversing your system. In such cases, JustiFi
will require you to provide an annual PCI-DSS Attestation of Compliance to ensure adherence to
security standards.

## Customer’s Compliance Journey

To embark on your PCI compliance journey:

1. **Assessment:** Determine your current compliance level.
2. **Implementation:** Apply necessary security measures and practices.
3. **Documentation:** Keep detailed records of compliance efforts.

## Case Scenarios

- **Scenario 1:** Using JustiFi's Payment Form for direct card processing and its impact on
  compliance scope.
- **Scenario 2:** Direct API integration for payment processing and its implications on PCI-DSS
  requirements.
