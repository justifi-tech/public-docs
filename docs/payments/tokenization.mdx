# Payment Method Tokenization

## Overview

Tokenization in payment processing is a crucial security measure. JustiFi's API leverages
tokenization to protect sensitive payment information such as credit card numbers and bank account
details, replacing them with unique identification symbols, or tokens.

## What is Tokenization?

Tokenization involves substituting sensitive data with non-sensitive equivalents, known as tokens.
These tokens, while not holding any intrinsic value, act as references to the original data securely
stored in a token vault.

### Benefits of Tokenization

- **Enhanced Security:** Minimizes the risk of data breaches by keeping sensitive information
  concealed.
- **PCI Compliance:** Aids in fulfilling [Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org)
  requirements.
- **Reduced Liability:** Decreases the volume of sensitive data that your system needs to handle.

## Implementing Tokenization

### Creating Tokens

- **API Call:** Instructions on executing an API call to generate a token representing a userâ€™s
  payment method.

- **Data Handling:** Explanation of how tokens are returned in response to successful API calls
  and can be utilized in future transactions.

### Using Tokens in Transactions

- **Processing Payments:** Guidelines on employing tokens to securely process payments.
- **Token Management:** Best practices for the storage, retrieval, and management of tokens.

## Example Implementation

To provide a practical understanding, here's an example implementation of tokenization in the
JustiFi API:

#### Card Tokenization Sample

```bash
curl -i -X POST \
  https://api.justifi.ai/v1/payment_methods \
  -H 'Authorization: <Bearer Token>' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Idempotency-Key: 497f6eca-6276-4993-bfeb-53cbbbba6f08' \
  -H 'Sub-Account: <sub-account id>' \
  -d '{
    "payment_method": {
      "card": {
        "name": "Lindsay Whalen",
        "number": 4242424242421111,
        "verification": 123,
        "month": 5,
        "year": 2042,
        "address_postal_code": 55555,
        "metadata": {
          "new": "info"
        }
      }
    }
  }'
```

#### Bank Tokenization Sample

```bash
curl -i -X POST \
  https://api.justifi.ai/v1/payment_methods \
  -H 'Authorization: <Bearer Token>' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Idempotency-Key: 497f6eca-6276-4993-bfeb-53cbbbba6f08' \
  -H 'Sub-Account: <sub-account id>' \
  -d '{
     "payment_method": {
      "bank_account": {
        "account_owner_name": "Lindsay Whalen",
        "routing_number": "110000000",
        "account_number": "000123456789",
        "account_type": "checking",
        "account_owner_type": "individual",
        "country": "US",
        "currency": "usd",
        "metadata": {
          "new": "info"
        }
      }
    }
  }'
```

Utilize JustiFi's tokenization feature in your payment processes to bolster security and ensure
compliance with prevailing industry standards.
