# Google Pay™ Web Component

Google Pay™ lets users pay with their cards stored in their Google account, providing a fast and secure checkout experience. If you provide Google Pay™ as a payment method to your customers, you must use the official Google Pay™ logo and button assets in compliance with [Google Pay Web Brand Guidelines](https://developers.google.com/pay/api/web/guides/brand-guidelines), without modifications to the Google Pay™ asset colors, proportions, or appearance.

**Note:** Google Pay™ is currently only supported in the [Hosted Checkout](/checkouts/hosted-checkout) product. Once Google Pay™ is enabled in your JustiFi merchant account dashboard, the Google Pay™ button will automatically appear as a payment option in your hosted checkout flow.

## Prerequisites

- Any device **compatible**, take a look [here](https://developers.google.com/pay/issuers/overview/supported-devices) for a comprehensive list.
- Your application must be served over **HTTPS**.

## Implementation Resources

For detailed implementation guidance, refer to the following Google Pay documentation:

- [Google Pay Web Developer Documentation](https://developers.google.com/pay/api/web/overview)
- [Google Pay Web Integration Checklist](https://developers.google.com/pay/api/web/guides/test-and-deploy/integration-checklist)

## Processing Google Pay™ Payments with Hosted Checkout

Our hosted checkout integration with Google Pay™ simplifies your ability to provide Google Pay™ as a payment option to your customers. Once you enable Google Pay™ in your JustiFi merchant account dashboard, the Google Pay™ button will automatically appear as a payment option in your hosted checkout. For more information on setting up and using hosted checkout, see our [Hosted Checkout documentation](/checkouts/hosted-checkout).

You must additionally complete the following essential steps to enable Google Pay™ functionality:

**Adhere to Google policies:** When using our hosted checkout with Google Pay™, merchants must adhere to the [Google Pay and Wallet API's Acceptable Use Policy](https://payments.developers.google.com/terms/aup) and accept the terms defined in the [Google Pay API Terms of Service](https://payments.developers.google.com/terms/sellertos).

**Content Security Policy (CSP) settings:** If your application uses Content Security Policy, you may need to update your CSP settings to allow the Google Pay™ SDK to function properly. Ensure your CSP allows connections to Google Pay™ domains and scripts.

**Enable Google Pay™ in your account:** Ensure that Google Pay™ is enabled in your JustiFi merchant account dashboard. Once enabled, the Google Pay™ button will automatically appear as a payment option in your hosted checkout. Contact your account representative if you need assistance enabling this feature.

For more details on using hosted checkout, see our [Hosted Checkout documentation](/checkouts/hosted-checkout).

## Implementation Details

### Gateway Configuration

As a supported payment service provider with the Google Pay™ API, our integration lets you as a merchant use Google Pay™ API's gateway integration type, where we handle all of the decryption on your behalf.

When using hosted checkout with Google Pay™, the following values are automatically set in the `TokenizationSpecification` object:

- **gateway:** The value `justifi` is automatically set by our platform in the hosted checkout.
- **gatewayMerchantID:** This value is automatically set to the sub account which the checkout was created under. For example, if you used your account with the id `acc_m9IjrorZoehPX9BA7kIrn`, we will pass `gateway:acc_m9IjrorZoehPX9BA7kIrn` as the merchant id.

Here is an example of what our hosted checkout will pass when initializing the Google Pay™ button:

```json
{
  "tokenizationSpecification": {
    "type": "PAYMENT_GATEWAY",
    "parameters": {
      "gateway": "justifi",
      "gatewayMerchantId": "gateway:acc_m9IjrorZoehPX9BA7kIrn"
    }
  }
}
```

### Authorization Methods

Google Pay™ provides two different authorization methods: `PAN_ONLY` and `CRYPTOGRAM_3DS`. Our hosted checkout integration with Google Pay™ supports both types of card credentials:

- **PAN_ONLY:** Physical card details stored in Google Pay™.
  - Supported countries: United States
  - 3D Secure (3DS) is not currently supported by JustiFi, so your merchants cannot enable 3DS for PAN_ONLY credentials

- **CRYPTOGRAM_3DS:** Tokenized virtual card stored on device.
  - Authentication is performed by Google Pay™.
  - Supported countries: United States

### Supported Card Networks

We support the following card networks with the Google Pay™ API in hosted checkout. These values are all passed to the `allowedCardNetworks` property automatically and find the appropriate values in [Google Pay's web developer documentation](https://developers.google.com/pay/api/web/guides/test-and-deploy/integration-checklist):

- VISA
- Mastercard
- American Express
- Discover

### Billing Address Requirements

A billing address is not required for our hosted checkout implementation of Google Pay™.

## Handling Google Pay™ Payment Data

When a customer pays with Google Pay™ through hosted checkout, it generates encrypted data which contains the payment data. The encrypted data is automatically sent to the JustiFi backend, and tokenized to a JustiFi Payment method.

### Completing a Checkout with Google Pay™

The hosted checkout automatically handles the secure Google Pay™ data and will complete a checkout upon a successful response from Google Pay™.

The Google Pay™ token will be extracted from the `paymentMethodData.tokenizationData.token` property of the PaymentData response object returned by Google Pay™.

For more information on completing checkouts, see our [Checkout API documentation](https://docs.justifi.tech/api-spec#tag/Checkouts/operation/CompleteCheckout).
