# Google Pay™ Web Component

Google Pay™ lets users pay with their cards stored in their Google account, providing a fast and secure checkout experience. If you provide Google Pay as a payment method to your customers, you must use the official Google Pay logo and button assets in compliance with [Google Pay Web Brand Guidelines](https://developers.google.com/pay/api/web/guides/brand-guidelines), without modifications to the Google Pay asset colors, proportions, or appearance.

## Prerequisites

- Any device **compatible**, take a look [here](https://developers.google.com/pay/issuers/overview/supported-devices) for a comprehensive list.
- Your application must be served over **HTTPS**.

## Implementation Resources

For detailed implementation guidance, refer to the following Google Pay documentation:

- [Google Pay Web Developer Documentation](https://developers.google.com/pay/api/web/overview)
- [Google Pay Web Integration Checklist](https://developers.google.com/pay/api/web/guides/test-and-deploy/integration-checklist)
- [Google Pay Web Brand Guidelines](https://developers.google.com/pay/api/web/guides/brand-guidelines)

## Processing Google Pay™ Payments with Hosted Checkout

Our hosted checkout integration with Google Pay simplifies your ability to provide Google Pay as a payment option to your customers. With our modular checkout, all the details necessary to display the Google Pay button as well as configuration to make the payment will already be correctly set.

You must additionally complete the following essential steps to enable Google Pay functionality:

**Adhere to Google policies:** All merchants are required to follow the [Google Pay and Wallet API's Acceptable Use Policy](https://payments.developers.google.com/terms/aup) and accept the terms defined in the [Google Pay API Terms of Service](https://payments.developers.google.com/terms/sellertos).

### Implementation Example

```html
<justifi-modular-checkout
  auth-token="your-auth-token"
  checkout-id="your-checkout-id"
>
  <justifi-google-pay />
</justifi-modular-checkout>
```

For more details on using our modular checkout, see our [modular checkout documentation](/web-components/modular-checkout/introduction).

## Implementation Details

### Gateway Configuration

As a supported payment service provider with the Google Pay API, our integration lets you as a merchant use Google Pay API's gateway integration type, where we handle all of the decryption on your behalf.

When you integrate with the Google Pay API as a merchant, ensure to set the following values in the `TokenizationSpecification` object:

- **gateway:** The value `justifi` is set by our platform when you load the web component.
- **gatewayMerchantID:** This value will automatically be set by the JustiFi Google Pay component, to be the sub account which the checkout was created
  under. For example, if you used your account with the id `acc_m9IjrorZoehPX9BA7kIrn`, we will pass `gateway:acc_m9IjrorZoehPX9BA7kIrn` as the merchant id.

Here is an example of what our component will pass when initalizing the Google Pay button:

```json
{
  "tokenizationSpecification": {
    "type": "PAYMENT_GATEWAY",
    "parameters": {
      "gateway": "justifi",
      "gatewayMerchantId": "gateway:acc_m9IjrorZoehPX9BA7kIrn"
    }
  }
}
```

### Authorization Methods

Google Pay provides two different authorization methods: `PAN_ONLY` and `CRYPTOGRAM_3DS`. Our integration with Google Pay supports both types of card credentials:

- **PAN_ONLY:** Physical card details stored in Google Pay™.

  - 3DS required: Yes, standard 3DS flow applies
  - Supported countries: United States

- **CRYPTOGRAM_3DS:** Tokenized virtual card stored on device.
  - 3DS required: No, authentication is performed by Google Pay™.
  - Supported countries: United States

### 3D Secure (3DS) for PAN_ONLY Credentials

We provide 3DS on Google Pay PAN_ONLY transactions. Standard 3DS flow applies to every PAN_ONLY credential returned from a Google Pay PAN_ONLY encrypted payload to initiate 3DS verification.

### Supported Card Networks

We support the following card networks with the Google Pay API. These values are all passed to the `allowedCardNetworks` property by the JustiFi component and find the appropriate values in [Google Pay's web developer documentation](https://developers.google.com/pay/api/web/guides/test-and-deploy/integration-checklist):

- VISA
- Mastercard
- American Express
- Discover

### Billing Address Requirements

A billing address is not required for our implementation of Google Pay.

## Handling Google Pay Payment Data

When a customer pays with Google Pay, it generates encrypted data which contains the payment data. The encrypted data is automatically sent to the JustiFi backend, and tokenized to a JustiFi Payment method.

### Completing a Checkout with Google Pay

The JustiFi Google Pay web component automatically handles the secure data, for you, and will complete a checkout upon a successful response from Google Pay.

The Google Pay token will be extracted from the `paymentMethodData.tokenizationData.token` property of the PaymentData response object returned by Google Pay.

For more information on completing checkouts, see our [Checkout API documentation](https://docs.justifi.tech/api-spec#tag/Checkouts/operation/CompleteCheckout).
