# Apple Pay Web Component Implementation Documentation

## Prerequisites

- Any device **compatible**, take a look [here](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102896) for a comprehensive list.
- Your application must be served over **HTTPS**.
- Ability to host a file under `/.well-known/` in the domain the checkout will be hosted.

## Enabling Apple Pay for your account

There are a few necessary steps to get your platform registered with JustiFi and Apple to be able to process Apple Pay payments, 
we wil list all steps and it's recommendations below, make sure to use it as a checklist to ensure your platform is setup properly.

### Platform Domain Names

You will be asked to provide all domain names that will be used to process payments from, these domains will be registered and validated 
with Apple, ensure you have access to host files under all provided domains.

It is important to mention that the FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name) is required, wildcard domains are not supported.

### Merchant Registration

In this step a merchant will be registered for your platform with all the domains provided in the step above, but **before** JustiFi can 
register your platform with Apple you will need to host a file provided on all domains under the path `/.well-known/apple-developer-merchantid-domain-association`.

Once the file is in place for all domains JustiFi will register your platform, if Apple is not able to reach and validate the files the 
registration will fail.

### Adding new domains

Adding new domains to your platform will require going through the step above again for the new domains, no change needed for the already 
registered domains.

### Processing Apple Pay Payments

Once your platform is successfully registered with Apple you are ready to start processing payments, you will be able to use our modular checkout 
to easily integrate Apple Pay payments, you will find the documentation [here](<modular_checkout_apple_pay_doc>). Below you will find an example 
implementation of the modular checkout and apple pay components:

```html
<justifi-modular-checkout
  auth-token="your-auth-token"
  checkout-id="your-checkout-id"
>
  <justifi-apple-pay display-name="your-custom-display-name" />
</justifi-modular-checkout>
```
