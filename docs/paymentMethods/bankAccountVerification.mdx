# Bank Account Verification

Bank account verification is a crucial step in ensuring the authenticity of bank accounts used for ACH payments. This
process provides a more secure and reliable way to link bank accounts to payment systems. For Bank Account Verification,
JustiFi supports integration with [Plaid](https://plaid.com/), a leading financial technology company that
specializes in connecting applications to users' bank accounts.

## Prerequisites

For bank account verification using Plaid, it's necessary to use JustiFi's Hosted Checkout or one of JustiFi's Web
Components that support Plaid integration, such as the
[Plaid Sub Component](https://storybook.justifi.ai/?path=/docs/modular-checkout-sub-components-plaid-payment-method--docs).

## Plaid Provisioning for Sub Accounts

To start using Plaid for bank account verification, it's essential to first provision the bank account verification
feature for the desired Sub Account. This can be done by adding the necessary information to the linked Business entity
and calling the entity provisioning endpoint, or by contacting JustiFi support for assistance.

The necessary information for the Business entity includes:
- Business Legal Name
- Business Website URL
- Business Legal Address

The entity provisioning endpoint should include the business ID and enable the `bank_account_verification` product
category.

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.justifi.ai/v1/entities/provisioning \
  --header 'authorization: Bearer {{access_token}}' \
  --header 'content-type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "business_id": "biz_123",
  "product_category": "bank_account_verification"
}'
```

After provisioning, JustiFi will handle the setup with Plaid, and once completed, the Sub Account will be able to use
Plaid for bank account verification.

## Plaid Provisioning for Platform Accounts

For Platform Accounts, it's necessary to contact JustiFi support to enable the bank account verification feature.
JustiFi will handle the provisioning process with Plaid on behalf of the Platform Account, and once completed, all Sub
Accounts under the Platform Account will be able to use Plaid for bank account verification.

## Using Plaid Bank Account Verification

After provisioning is complete and the bank account verification setting is enabled, Plaid can be used as a payment
method option during the checkout process:
- If [Hosted Checkout](../checkouts/hosted-checkout.mdx) is used, Plaid will automatically appear as a payment method
option after provisioning is completed.
- If [Unified Checkout](https://storybook.justifi.ai/?path=/docs/payment-facilitation-unified-fintech-checkout%E2%84%A2--docs)
web component is used, Plaid will automatically appear as a payment method option.
- If [Modular Checkout](https://storybook.justifi.ai/?path=/docs/modular-checkout--docs) web component is used, the
[Plaid Sub Component](https://storybook.justifi.ai/?path=/docs/modular-checkout-sub-components-plaid-payment-method--docs)
needs to be included.
