# Bank Account Verification

Bank account verification is a crucial step in ensuring the authenticity of bank accounts used for ACH payments. This
process provides a more secure and reliable way to link bank accounts to payment systems. For Bank Account Verification,
JustiFi supports integration with [Plaid](https://plaid.com/), a leading financial technology company that
specializes in connecting applications to users' bank accounts.

## Prerequisites

Bank account verification via Plaid is available in the following JustiFi checkout options:

- [Hosted Checkout](https://docs.justifi.tech/checkouts/hosted-checkout)
- [Unified Fintech Checkout web component](https://storybook.justifi.ai/?path=/docs/payment-facilitation-unified-fintech-checkout%E2%84%A2--docs)
- [Modular Checkout web component](https://storybook.justifi.ai/?path=/docs/modular-checkout--docs) if the Plaid Payment
Method sub component is included

Bank Account Verification is not available in the [Tokenize Payment Method web component](https://storybook.justifi.ai/?path=/docs/payment-facilitation-tokenize-payment-method--docs)
or via JustiFi API.

## Plaid Provisioning
To get started your platform or specific sub accounts need to be provisioned with Plaid. This section explains the
process.

### Provision your Platform

To enable Plaid bank account verification for all sub account of your platform please contact [JustiFi Customer Success](platform_success@justifi.tech).
JustiFi will handle the provisioning process with Plaid on behalf of your platform account.

### Provision a Sub Account

To provision a Sub Account with plaid use the JustiFi API:

1. Determine the business ID of the sub account you want to enable for bank account verification via [get sub account
API](https://docs.justifi.tech/api-spec#tag/Sub-Accounts/operation/GetSubAccount). The business ID is listed in the
response. (Note: The sub account you are provisioning needs to be enabled for
payment processing)

2. Get the business via get business API and confirm the business includes the following information:
   - Business Legal Name
   - Business Website URL
   - Business Legal Address

    Add any missing information to the business via [update business API](https://docs.justifi.tech/api-spec#tag/Business/operation/UpdateBusiness).

3. Provision the business via the [provisioning API](https://docs.justifi.tech/api-spec#tag/Provisioning). Pass the
business ID and `bank_account_verification` as `product_category`.

    ```bash
      curl --request POST \
      --url https://api.justifi.ai/v1/entities/provisioning \
      --header 'authorization: Bearer {{access_token}}' \
      --header 'content-type: application/json' \
      --data '{
        "business_id": "biz_123",
        "product_category": "bank_account_verification"
      }'
    ```

## Using Plaid Bank Account Verification

After provisioning is complete and the bank account verification setting is enabled, Plaid can be used as a payment
method option during the checkout process:
- If [Hosted Checkout](../checkouts/hosted-checkout.mdx) is used, Plaid will automatically appear as a payment method
option after provisioning is completed.
- If [Unified Fintech Checkout](https://storybook.justifi.ai/?path=/docs/payment-facilitation-unified-fintech-checkout%E2%84%A2--docs)
web component is used, Plaid will automatically appear as a payment method option.
- If [Modular Checkout](https://storybook.justifi.ai/?path=/docs/modular-checkout--docs) web component is used, the
[Plaid Sub Component](https://storybook.justifi.ai/?path=/docs/modular-checkout-sub-components-plaid-payment-method--docs)
needs to be included.

## Testing Plaid Bank Account Verification

Plaid bank account verification is available in test mode and utilizes Plaid's sandbox environment with simulated bank
accounts. The Unified Fintech Checkout and Modular Checkout web components as well as Hosted Checkout automatically
connect to Plaid's sandbox when in test mode.

To simulate a Plaid bank account verification any values for user credentials and verification codes are accepted.
