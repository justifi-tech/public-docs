# Providing Payment Method Options

Payment methods must be tokenized using one of **[JustiFi's web components for payment facilitation](/web-components/)**
before they can be used for payments. These web components securely collect card or bank account details
and return a payment method token.

- **[Tokenize Payment Method Web Component](https://docs.justifi.tech/web-components/payment-facilitation/tokenize-payment-method):** 
  Use this embedded web component to securely collect and tokenize
  card and bank account details for later charge. 
  **[Modular Checkout](https://docs.justifi.tech/web-components/modular-checkout) and [Unified Fintech Checkout](https://docs.justifi.tech/web-components/payment-facilitation/unified-fintech-checkout%E2%84%A2) Web Component: 
  Use either of these embedded web components to securely tokenize
  a payment method and charge it. It offers customization and a variety of payment method options. 
- **[Hosted Checkout](https://docs.justifi.tech/checkouts/hosted-checkout):** Offer a variety of payment method options to your users for processing a payment via JustiFi Hosted Checkout.
  It automatically handles tokenization.
- **Reduced PCI Scope:** Because the web components handle sensitive payment data, your application
  never directly touches card numbers or bank account details, significantly reducing your PCI compliance burden.

> **Note:** Creating payment methods directly via the API requires prior approval. Contact [JustiFi Customer Success](mailto:customer_success@justifi.tech)
> if you have a use case that requires requires direct PAN (Primary Account Number) submission. At minimum, a completed SAQ (Self-Assessment Questionnaire)
> is required to allow raw PAN submissions. See our [API documentation](https://docs.justifi.tech/api-spec#tag/Payment-Methods)
> for details.

By using JustiFi's web components, your business can cater to various customer preferences
and transaction scenarios while maintaining security and efficiency.
