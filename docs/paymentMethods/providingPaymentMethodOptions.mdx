# Providing Payment Method Options

Payment methods must be tokenized using the **[JustiFi Payment Method Web Component](/web-components/)**
before they can be used for payments. The web component securely collects card or bank account details
and returns a payment method token.

- **Payment Method Web Component:** Use JustiFi's embedded web component to securely collect and tokenize
  card and bank account details. This is the recommended approach for all new integrations.
- **Hosted Checkout:** Offer a variety of payment method options to your users via JustiFi Hosted Checkout,
  which handles tokenization automatically.
- **Reduced PCI Scope:** Because the web component handles sensitive payment data, your application
  never directly touches card numbers or bank account details, significantly reducing your PCI compliance burden.

> **Note:** Creating payment methods directly via the API requires prior approval. Contact JustiFi support
> if you have a use case that requires this. At minimum, a completed SAQ (Self-Assessment Questionnaire)
> is required to allow raw PAN submissions. See our [API documentation](https://docs.justifi.tech/api-spec#tag/Payment-Methods)
> for details.

By using JustiFi's web components, your business can cater to various customer preferences
and transaction scenarios while maintaining security and efficiency.
