# Payment Method Groups (PMG)

Payment method groups offer a way to organize and filter payment methods of your users.

It also allows you to display already save payment methods to a user in the checkout form when using
[Hosted Checkout](../checkouts/hosted-checkout.mdx) or one of the checkout web components (
[Unified Fintech Checkout](https://storybook.justifi.ai/?path=/docs/payment-facilitation-unified-fintech-checkout%E2%84%A2--docs)
or [Modular Checkout](https://storybook.justifi.ai/?path=/docs/modular-checkout--docs)).

Here is how to use it:

1. Create a payment method group
2. Associate existing payment methods
3. Create a checkout and pass the payment method group ID

## Creating PMGs

To create a PMG refer to the [Create a Payment Method Group](https://docs.justifi.tech/api-spec#tag/Payment-Method-Groups/operation/CreatePaymentMethodGroup)
specification.

## Associating payment methods

- **Create Checkout:**
Create a checkout via [create checkout API](https://docs.justifi.tech/api-spec#tag/Checkouts/operation/CreateCheckout)
and pass the payment method group ID as `payment_method_group_id`. Once you load the Hosted Checkout form or the
checkout web component for this checkout the saved payment methods will be displayed to the user.

- **Associating existing payment methods:**
Refer to the [Update a Payment Method Group](https://docs.justifi.tech/api-spec#tag/Payment-Method-Groups/operation/PatchPaymentMethodGroup)
specification.
