# Payment Method Groups (PMG)

Payment Method Groups offer a way to filter payment methods by a group.

## Creating PMGs

## Associating payment methods

There are two ways currently available to associate payment methods to a PMG:
- **When creating a payment method:**
Refer to the [Create a Payment Method](https://docs.justifi.tech/api-spec#tag/Payment-Methods/operation/CreatePaymentMethod) specification, an example payload
is available in the payloads dropdown.

- **Associating existing payment methods:**
Refer to the [Update a Payment Method Group](https://docs.justifi.tech/api-spec#tag/Payment-Method-Groups/operation/UpdatePaymentMethodGroup) specification.
