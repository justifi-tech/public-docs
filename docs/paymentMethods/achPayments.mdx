# ACH Payments

ACH payments are electronic payments made through the ACH network. They are ideal for direct bank-to-bank transactions,
such as direct deposits and bill payments.

## Key Features

- **Cost-Effective:** Lower transaction fees compared to other methods.
- **Security:** Enhanced safety measures for secure transactions.
- **Convenience:** Suitable for recurring payments, consumers without access to cards, and other high value purchases.

:::note
ACH payments are available for USD processing only. For Canadian dollar (CAD) payment processing, card-based payment methods are supported through a dedicated Canada platform account.
