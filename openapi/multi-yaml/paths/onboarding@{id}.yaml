  summary: Create an Onboarding Entry
  description: |
    _<strong>Note: For onboarding version "v2.0", we have recently added more required fields, identification numnber (full ssn) for representative and owners, full address for owners, and date of incorporation and approx annual volume for businesses. We will still accept v1.0 payload, but these additional fields are required to enable a sub account.</strong>_

    First, you'll need to [create a sub account](https://docs.justifi.tech/api-spec#tag/Sub-Accounts/operation/CreateSubAccount) so you can use that sub account id in the path for this API.

    Create an onboarding entry for a sub account, which will send their required onboarding information to the JustiFi team for review. This will change the sub account's status to `submitted`. Upon review, if we require additional verification in the form of an ID document (which is rare), we'll work with your sub account to obtain the documentation we need.

    Depending on each sub account's business type and structure, the onboarding information you'll need to collect will vary. Use the table below to check the requirements for each. You can also get a head start by copying the payloads from the request samples on the right; just choose the type of business you need from the dropdown first. _Note: The payload, response, and restrictions are all subject to change based on gateway requirements._
