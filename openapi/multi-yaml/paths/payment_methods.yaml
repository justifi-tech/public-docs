  summary: Create a Payment Method
  description: |
    You can create payment methods ahead of time, then pass their existing tokens to payments.
    Alternatively, you can create and tokenize payment methods inline when processing payments.

    *Note: For platforms, if the sub account status is not `enabled`, `400` will be returned.*
