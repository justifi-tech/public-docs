  summary: Create a Payment Method
  description: |
    **This endpoint requires prior approval.** New integrations should use the
    **[JustiFi Payment Method Web Component](https://docs.justifi.tech/web-components/)** to securely collect and tokenize payment method details.

    The web component handles PCI-scoped data collection and returns a payment method token that you can pass to the
    [Create Payment](https://docs.justifi.tech/api-spec#tag/Payments/operation/CreatePayment) endpoint.

    If you have a use case that requires creating payment methods directly via the API, contact JustiFi support for approval. At minimum, a completed SAQ (Self-Assessment Questionnaire) is required to allow raw PAN submissions.

    *Note: If the sub account status is not `enabled`, `400` will be returned.*
