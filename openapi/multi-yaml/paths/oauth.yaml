  summary: Generate Access Token
  description: |
    To get an access token, post your `client_id` and `client_secret`.
    The request responds with an access token, which is valid for 24 hours. Pass the token as the `Authorization`
    header with `Bearer` appended before the token, e.g. `Bearer {access_token}`.

    **Note: These access tokens are meant only for backend-to-backend calls. If you are looking to authorize
    a web component, please see the Web Component Token API**
