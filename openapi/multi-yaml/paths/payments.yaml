  summary: Create a Payment
  description: |
    Authorize, capture, and charge a payment method. We limit concurrency to 10 concurrent requests per platform.
    This is due to the nature of the payments API, to reduce rejections, and false positive fraud detection during bulk
    payment processing.

    **Payment methods must be tokenized before creating a payment.** Tokenize payment methods use the embedded
    **[JustiFi Tokenize Payment Method Web Component](https://docs.justifi.tech/web-components/payment-facilitation/tokenize-payment-method)** 
    to securely collect and tokenize card or bank account details.

    Once you have a payment method token (e.g. `pm_justifi123`), pass it in the `payment_method.token` field to create a payment.

    > **Note:** Passing raw card or bank account details directly to this endpoint requires prior approval. Contact [JustiFi Customer Success](mailto:customer_success@justifi.tech) 
    if you have a use case that requires direct PAN submission. At minimum, a completed SAQ (Self-Assessment Questionnaire) is required to allow raw PAN submissions.

    *Note: If the sub account status is not `enabled`, `400` will be returned.*

            application_fee_amount:
              type: integer
              description: |
                Sets a custom application fee amount that applies to this payment, instead of relying on application fee rates configured at the platform account level (*only Platforms may set application_fee_amount*). Must be greater than zero.

                **New integrations** should use the `fees` array instead for granular control over fee types and selective refunds. See [Enhanced Fee Management](#section/Enhanced-Fee-Management).

                Cannot be used together with `fees`.
              example: 400
            fees:
              type: array
              description: |
                Array of fee objects to charge on this payment. See [Enhanced Fee Management](https://docs.justifi.tech/api-spec#section/Enhanced-Fee-Management) for full documentation.

                Each fee object specifies:
                - `type`: `processing_fee` or `platform_fee` (required)
                - `amount`: Fee amount in cents (required)

                **Benefits over `application_fee_amount`:**
                - Separate fee types for clear reporting
                - Selective refunds: Choose which fees to return
                - Each fee type appears as a separate balance transaction

                Cannot be used together with `application_fee_amount`.

                **Testing Disputes**: Include `dispute_test_spec` to create test disputes:
                - `expected_result`: `"won"` or `"lost"` - Final dispute outcome
                - `reason`: Dispute reason (`"fraudulent"`, `"unrecognized"`, `"duplicate"`, `"subscription_canceled"`, `"product_unacceptable"`, `"product_not_received"`, `"processing_error"`, `"credit_not_processed"`, `"general"`)
                - `due_date`: Response deadline in YYYY-MM-DD format
