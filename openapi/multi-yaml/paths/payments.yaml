  summary: Create a Payment
  description: |
    Authorize, capture, and charge a payment method. We limit concurrency to 10 concurrent requests per platform.
    This is due to the nature of the payments API, to reduce rejections, and false positive fraud detection during bulk
    payment processing.

    *Note: If the sub account status is not `enabled`, `400` will be returned.*

              description: |
                **Deprecated**: Use the `fees` array instead for granular control over fee types and selective refunds.

                Sets a custom application fee amount that applies to this payment, instead of relying on application fee rates configured at the platform account level (*only Platforms may set application_fee_amount*). Must be greater than zero.

                Existing integrations using this field will continue to work, but new integrations should use the `fees` array.

                **Note**: You cannot use both `application_fee_amount` and `fees` in the same request.
              example: 400
            fees:
              type: array
              description: |
                Array of fee objects to charge on this payment. Each fee has a type and amount. Use this instead of `application_fee_amount` for granular control over different fee types and selective refunds.

                Supported fee types:
                - `processing_fee`: Fees related to payment processing costs
                - `platform_fee`: Fees for your platform's services

                **Validation rules:**
                - Only one fee of each type is allowed per request
                - Total fees cannot exceed the payment amount
                - Cannot be used together with `application_fee_amount`

                See [Enhanced Fee Management](#section/Enhanced-Fee-Management) for full documentation.
