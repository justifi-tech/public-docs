                Array of fee objects to return to the merchant. If omitted, no fees are returned.

                Each fee object specifies:
                - `type`: The fee type to refund (`processing_fee` or `platform_fee`)
                - `amount`: Amount to return in cents

                **Validation:**
                - The requested amount cannot exceed the remaining amount for that fee type on the original payment
                - The fee type must exist on the original payment

                See [Enhanced Fee Management](#section/Enhanced-Fee-Management) for full documentation.
