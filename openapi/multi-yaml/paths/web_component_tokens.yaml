  summary: Generate A Token
  description: |
    The web component token provides permission to render a web component on your frontend. 
    To get a web component token post your [access token](https://docs.justifi.tech/api-spec#tag/API-Credentials/operation/CreateAccessToken) in the header and the `business_id` or `account_id` as part of the `resources` array in the body.
    For a list of resources needed for each web component please refer to [Roles need for each component](https://docs.justifi.tech/infrastructure/webComponentTokens#roles-need-for-each-component).
    The token will be valid for 60 minutes.
