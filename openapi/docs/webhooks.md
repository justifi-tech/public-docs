In addition to direct EventBridge publishing, we offer event delivery to your app via webhooks.
Webhooks are a reliable method to subscribe to our published events via an API endpoint.

Webhooks are secured by signature verification, which you will need to verify by generating a SHA-256 hex using the following information:

| Parameter  | Header            | Value                                                           |
|------------|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Timestamp  | JUSTIFI-TIMESTAMP | ISO string format                                               |
| Signature  | JUSTIFI-SIGNATURE | String                                                          |
| Algorithm  | ----------------- | SHA-256                                                         |
| Secret Key | ----------------- | Found in your event publisher's page                            |
| Message    | ----------------- | String in the format `<timestamp_header>.<received_event_json>` |

To verify the signature simply compare the generated SHA-256 hex against it; if it is successful the webhook signature is valid.

Here is a code example for reference:
```ruby
def webhook_signature_valid?(signature, received_event, timestamp, secret_key)
  timestamp_payload = "#{timestamp}.#{received_event.to_json}"
  algorithm = OpenSSL::Digest.new("sha256")
  hex = OpenSSL::HMAC.hexdigest(algorithm, secret_key, timestamp_payload)

  signature == hex
end
```

If you are using any of our SDKs, we provide a convenient method for validating the signature.

After validating, you must respond with a `200 OK` with in **5 seconds**. In the event of a non-200 response or a delay of more than 5 seconds, delivery will be
attempted again. For live accounts, webhooks are retried 10 times over 24 hours.
For test accounts, webhooks are retried 3 times over 1 hour.

**When you're ready to get started:**

- Create the endpoint on your server that will receive published events
- Add an event publisher with webhook delivery method in the Developer Tools section of the app (youâ€™ll subscribe your endpoint to the event types of your choice). We recommend starting with a test account.
- Test the publisher by prompting one of the event types you chose and making sure your subscribed endpoint receives the published event
