## Introduction
The JustiFi API is a REST-based payment processing API. Our API has predictable, resource-oriented URLs, accepts JSON, and returns JSON. We use HTTP status codes and supply detailed error codes whenever possible. We'll provide you with both a `test` and `live` account with which to use our API. Each account will have its own API key, and the key you use to authenticate each request will determine whether to use your `test` or `live` account. When you use your `test` account, it won't affect your `live` data or move any real money.

## Getting Started
To process a payment with JustiFi, follow these steps

- [Get Your Accounts](#get-your-accounts)
- [Get Your API Keys](#get-your-api-keys)
- [Authenticate With JustiFi](#authenticate-with-justifi)
- For Platforms, [Create and Onboard Your Sub Accounts](https://docs.justifi.tech/api-spec#tag/Sub-Accounts)
- [Create a Payment](https://docs.justifi.tech/api-spec#tag/Payments/operation/CreatePayment)

<br>

### Get Your Accounts
Our customer onboarding team will work with you to create your `test` and `live` accounts. For platforms, our team will also guide you through setting up your sub accounts onboarding. Once you're up and running, you'll have access to the JustiFi API as well as the admin features at https://app.justifi.ai where you can see your account overview, payments, payouts, issue refunds, etc.

<br>

### Get Your API Keys
Once your `test` and `live` accounts have been created, you'll have access to generate your API keys in the Developer Tools section of the app. You'll need a `test` key and a `live` key. Each key will provide you with a client id and a client secret, which you'll use to authenticate your API requests. Requests authenticated with your `test` key will use your `test` account; requests authenticated with your `live` key will use your `live` account. Make sure to store your client secrets somewhere secure (like a password manager) because this is the only time they'll display in the UI.

Additionally, we can provide access to a sandbox environment upon request.

### Authenticate With JustiFi
<PullRight>

##### Example OAuth Client Credentials Grant Request
```sh
curl -X POST https://api.justifi.ai/oauth/token \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data '{"client_id":"[your client id]","client_secret":"[your client secret]"}'
```
  ##### Example Authenticated Response
```json
{
  "access_token": "... this will be a very long string and is valid for 24 hours"
}
```
##### Example Authenticated Request
```sh
curl -X POST https://api.justifi.ai/v1/payments \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer [access_token]' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
    -H 'Idempotency-Key: a-unique-string-for-the-transaction'
```
</PullRight>

JustiFi uses the OAuth Client Credentials authentication flow. To access, use your JustiFi client id and client secret to POST to https://api.justifi.ai/oauth/token. These are valid for 24 hours. The test key is prepended with `test_` and the live key is prepended with `live_`.

Next, take the access token in that response and pass it in all subsequent requests as the `Authorization` header.

This token is valid for 24 hours, so be sure to handle a `401 - Unauthorized` response by getting a new access token via the client credentials grant API.

## Idempotent Requests
<PullRight>

##### Example Request with Idempotency-Key Header
```sh
curl -X POST https://api.justifi.ai/v1/payments \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer [access_token]' \
    -H 'Accept: application/json'
    -H 'Idempotency-Key: a-unique-string-for-the-transaction'
```
</PullRight>

In order to guarantee that payments and other important transactions are only ever processed a single time, we leverage the `Idempotency-Key` header in our payments APIs. This means that you MUST provide an `Idempotency-Key` header along with your request, otherwise you'll receive an error. If a second request with same idempotent key is processed concurrently, it will result in a `409` error instead of double processing.

If these requests fail with a network timeout or a `5XX` error, they should be retried with the same exact parameters. Once they're fully successful, you'll receive a `2XX` response. If you POST the same request and `Idempotency-Key` again, you'll get the response you originally received back. If you receive a `4XX` error, do not retry the request, unless the response code is a `409`.

If you try the same `Idempotency-Key` with different parameters, your request will error and won't be possible to process. The `Idempotency-Key` header is only meant for a single transaction; it's there to protect against processing the same exact thing more than once. Once the parameters change, a request is considered distinct from the original request.

You may use any string to identify your `Idempotency-Key`; we generally recommend using a generated uuid, but you may use any unique string.

## Pagination
<PullRight>

##### Example Paginated Request
```sh
curl -X GET https://api.justifi.ai/v1/payments?limit=25&after_cursor=token-from-page-info \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer [access_token]' \
    -H 'Accept: application/json'
```
##### Example Paginated Response
```sh
{
    "id": null,
    "type": "array",
    "data":[
        { "id":"py_438xBom2Drh55kE1WfyGLg",
          "amount": 1000,
          ... additional response attributes based on resource schema
        }
    ],
    "page_info": {
      "has_previous": false,
      "has_next": true,
      "start_cursor": "WyIyMDIyLTAxLTExIDE1OjI3OjM2LjAyNzc3MDAwMCIsImNhNjQwMTk1LTEzYzMtNGJlZi1hZWQyLTU3ZjA1MzhjNjNiYSJd",
      "end_cursor": "WyIyMDIyLTAxLTExIDEyOjU5OjQwLjAwNTkxODAwMCIsImQ0Njg5MGE2LTJhZDItNGZjNy1iNzdkLWFiNmE3MDJhNTg3YSJd"
    }
}
```
</PullRight>
All top-level API resources have support for bulk fetches via `array` API methods. JustiFi uses cursor-based pagination, which supports `limit`, `before_cursor` and `after_cursor`. Each response will have a `page_info` object that contains the `has_next` and `has_previous` fields, which tells you if there are more items before or after the current page.  The `page_info` object also includes `start_cursor` and `end_cursor` values which can be used in conjunction with `before_cursor` and `after_cursor` to retrieve items from the API one page at a time.

#### Standard `array` API Request Parameters

<table layout="fixed">
    <tr>
        <th style="width: 200px">Parameter</th>
        <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td style="vertical-align: top"><code>limit</code></td>
        <td>
            The number of resources to retrieve.<br />
            <b>type</b>: <code>integer</code><br />
            <b>default</b>: <code>25</code><br />
            <b>minimum</b>: <code>1</code><br />
            <b>maximum</b>: <code>100</code>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td style="vertical-align: top"><code>after_cursor</code></td>
        <td>
            Token to fetch the next page of a list.<br />
            <b>type</b>: <code>string</code><br />
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td style="vertical-align: top"><code>before_cursor</code></td>
        <td>
            Token to fetch the previous page of a list.<br />
            <b>type</b>: <code>string</code><br />
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

The `after_cursor`/`before_cursor` parameter determines which page of results will be returned.
If `after_cursor` is the encoded `id` of the last record in the collection `has_next` will be false and you'll get an empty array response. If `before_cursor` is the encoded `id` of the first record in the collection `has_previous` will be false and you'll get an empty array response.

The `limit` parameter determines the maximum number of results included in each response. If there are fewer
records available than the `limit` value, the response will include all available records. The maximum value
allowed is 100 with a default value of 25. If the `limit` value is an invalid type, the default value of 25 is used.

#### Standard API Response Structure
All of our responses are contained in the same envelope, for arrays the id field will be null
and the object will be an array.

<table layout="fixed">
    <tr>
        <th style="width: 200px">Attribute</th>
        <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td style="vertical-align: top"><code>id</code></td>
        <td>
            The id of the object returned. Will be null for arrays.<br />
            <b>type</b>: <code>string</code><br />
            <b>default</b>: <code>"a uuid"</code>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td style="vertical-align: top"><code>type</code></td>
        <td>
            The type of object returned.<br />
            <b>type</b>: <code>string</code><br />
            <b>default</b>: <code>"array"</code>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td style="vertical-align: top"><code>data</code></td>
        <td>
            The resource OR an array of the requested resources.<br />
            <b>type</b>: <code>array | object</code><br />
            <b>Notes</b>: May be an empty array <code>[]</code> if no resources are available.<br />
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td style="vertical-align: top"><code>page_info</code></td>
        <td>
            The object containing pagination information.<br />
            <b>type</b>: <code>object</code><br />
            <b>Notes</b>: Contains <code>has_previous</code>, <code>has_next</code>, <code>start_cursor</code> and <code>end_cursor</code>
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

## Testing
Use these card numbers to test successful transactions as well as various error scenarios. Make sure to authenticate your requests using your `test` API key (these cards won't work for `live` payments).

## HTTP Errors
The JustiFi API may return a number of standard HTTP errors due to invalid requests. Some common errors are described
below to help you build with JustiFi.

#### Bad Request
The server cannot process the request. This error is most likely due to malformed request syntax.
- code: `400`
- status: `Bad Request`

#### Unauthorized
Similar to a `403 Forbidden`, but specifically when authentication is provided and has failed, or has not been provided.
This error is most likely due to not including your API key in the request header.
- code: `401`
- status: `Unauthorized`

#### Payment Required
There was an error processing the payment. This response is returned when errors occur while tokenizing the payment method, such
as an invalid cvc or an expiration date in the past. This can also occur when making a payment and the card is declined.
In that case, the error message will provide more specific information about why the request was declined.
- code: `402`
- status: `Payment Required`

#### Forbidden
The request was valid, but you are unable to execute the request. This error is most likely due to the API key that
was used not having the necessary permissions, or attempting a prohibited action such as creating a duplicate
record where one already exists.
- code: `403`
- status: `Forbidden`

#### Not Found
The requested resource could not be found, but may be available in the future. This error is most likely due to
requesting a resource by `id` that doesn't exist. You'll want to double check that you're referencing the correct
`id` and that it exists on your account.
- code: `404`
- status: `Not Found`

#### Concurrent Request Error
The request has an identical `Idempotency-Key` header for another request which either failed OR is processing at the same time. You can retry these requests without risk of double processing.
- code: `409`
- status: `Conflict`

#### Unprocessable Entity
The request was well-formed, but was unable to be processed due to semantic errors. This error is most likely due to
including invalid data in `POST`, `PATCH`, and `PUT` requests. Double check the request documentation to make sure
you're supplying the required attributes, and that the attribute types are correct.
- code: `422`
- status: `Unprocessable Entity`

#### Internal Server Error
An internal server error occurred due to an unexpected condition. This error is most likely due to an issue with our
servers.
- code: `500`
- status: `Internal Server Error`

#### Error Codes

Many of our `4XX` errors will provide an error code in addition to their HTTP status. Here is a list of our error codes and a brief description of the error to provide more context when applicable.

## Network Errors
We provide the network error code, and the network error category to help inform you how to handle a decline. These are only returned when a transaction fails while trying to process on the card network. Please take a look at each section. The network error category is especially relevant for recurring payments. It can reduce retries on transactions which will never succeed.

### Network Error Codes

In addition to the standard error codes provided by JustiFi, some errors may include a `network_error_code` that provides more specific information about the error from the payment network. Here's a list of common `network_error_code` values and their meanings:

### Network Error Category
Both Visa and Mastercard send additional information about how to handle a declined payment for recurring payments. Effective May 30th, 2025 we pass through this information to help handle failures. We have added the `network` and `network_error_category` attributes to declined payments, when we get the additional information from the card networks. We are working on further classification of errors, for now please only respond to those documented here.

| network | network_error_category | Definition |
|------|--------------|--------------------------------------|
| VISA | 1 | Issuer will never approve. Do not attempt again. This indicates the card is invalid, never existed or block. Cardholders can contact their bank for more information. |
| VISA | 2 | Issuer cannot approve at this time. They may try again at another time. This could be related to credit risk, velocity controls, or system issues. |
| VISA | 3 | Issuer cannot approve based on the details provided. This might be an invalid cvv, expiration date, etc. Do not try again without attempting to obtain additional information. |
| VISA | R00/R01 | Recurring payment not allowed on card. Do not attempt again. |
| MASTERCARD | 01 | Updated information needed. Similar to Visa code 3. |
| MASTERCARD | 02 | Try again later. Similar to Visa code 2. |
