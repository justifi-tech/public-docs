title: Release Flow for Web Components Docs
description: How versions are cut and docs are synced from the Web Component Library.
sidebar_label: Release flow
---

This site hosts the Web Components documentation at `/web-components/*` using a dedicated docs plugin with its own versioning. The content is synced from the public `web-component-library` repository.

## Automated sync

- A GitHub Action runs on manual dispatch to:
  - Fetch docs from `packages/webcomponents/src/docs/**` and `packages/webcomponents/src/components/*/docs/**`
  - Copy assets to `static/img/web-components/**`
  - Open a pull request with changes

## Cutting a docs version

Docs versions should align to the major.minor of `@justifi/webcomponents` (e.g., `6.4`):

```bash
pnpm version:webcomponents 6.4
```

This freezes the current docs under `wc-docs/versioned_docs/version-6.4`. The navbar switcher shows the current "Next" and any released versions.

## Mapping of source to target

- `packages/webcomponents/src/docs/overview/**` → `wc-docs/overview/**`
- Other files under `packages/webcomponents/src/docs/**` → `wc-docs/guides/**`
- `packages/webcomponents/src/components/<Component>/docs/**` → `wc-docs/components/<Component>/**`
- Images referenced relatively are rewritten to `/img/web-components/...`
