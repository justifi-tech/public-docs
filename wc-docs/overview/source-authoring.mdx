Author docs next to code in the Web Component Library:

## Locations

- Component docs:
  - `packages/webcomponents/src/components/<Component>/docs/`
  - `index.mdx` (overview), optional `examples/*.mdx`, and `assets/*` for images
- General docs:
  - `packages/webcomponents/src/docs/overview/*`
  - `packages/webcomponents/src/docs/guides/*`

## Frontmatter

Each MD/MDX page should include:

```mdx
---
title: Page title
description: Short summary for SEO
sidebar_label: Optional short label
slug: Optional custom slug
---
```

## Assets and links

- Reference images relatively, e.g. `./assets/example.png`.
- Avoid absolute repo paths; use relative links between docs.
- Tabs, admonitions and standard MDX are supported.

During sync, assets are moved to `/img/web-components/**` and links are rewritten automatically.
